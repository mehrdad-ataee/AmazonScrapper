B08842D7JS,R3LDQG4VKY6M8L,Carfo,An incredibly capabale gaming laptop that has a lot of value for the price,"This is a very good laptop that is very capable of AAA gaming at high settings. It was packaged well with seals to prevent any kind of tampering during shipping. Included was a very basic, but free neoprene sleeve for the laptop. There are no straps or pouches but it is soft and will protect the laptop during travel better than if it were left exposed, but I would still suggest getting a carrying case or a backpack if you do plan on being portable with this. Also included was an HDD upgrade cable and screws in case you want to add a your own 2.5'' drive to the empty bay on the motherboard.

The 1080p 3ms 144hz IPS display looks great and also has great viewing angles. If you've never used a 144hz Panel before, you can never go back to 60Ghz monitors for gaming again. 144Hz ruined my last gaming laptop because the difference is extremely noticeable (in general, it feels smoother when you move in games) compared to 60Hz panels. The webcam is passable at 720p. It's fine for chatting with friends or zoom meetings but not recommended for anything beyond that. It also cannot work with Windows Hello. The 10th gen Intel i7-10750H 6core 2.6Ghz base clock speed processor is very efficient, powerful, and has decent integrated graphics (which the laptop will prefer to use when you aren't playing games or doing any kind of intensive work that would require more GPU power). There's a lot of value in this laptop given that this CPU alone is sold for $400 and the laptop also has an RTX 2060 6GB. The RTX is the newest architecture that has the ability to do ray-tracing. If you don't know what that is, it's realistic lighting effects that developers are putting into games now, but you need a card that has the ability to process it or you can't take advantage of the feature.

The RTX 2060 GPU is very capable. My average FPS with very high settings on Assassin's Creed Odyssey was 70. In GTA V on high settings, it was 115. Interestingly, this laptop has a button called Turbo. Now, there's no overt explanation for what it does when you take the laptop out of the box and don't read the manual, but it essentially overclocks the GPU for you and kicks the fans into hyper-drive to compensate for the extra heat involved with overclocking it. In terms of performance, on the two games I tested the FPS on, it gave me an average of a 10FPS increase. It is noisy though when the fans are on full blast. I have to give credit to the fans which Acer advertises as ""4th Gen AeroBlade™ 3D technology"" and the thermal management of this design because even when the CPU and GPU are being stressed, the laptop stays at a reasonable temperature, and by that I mean you can game with it on your laptop while sitting down without it becoming too uncomfortable. Aside from the Turbo button, there's also a Predator button on the keyboard. Pressing this opens an application that shows you the current temperatures of CPU/GPU and even ambient temperature inside the laptop itself overall. You can customize your lighting profile here, overclock your GPU with 3 speeds (normal, fast, extreme), and you can set your fan speeds to a custom setting or leave it on automatic. Because Acer has this application that controls these settings from OS, the UEFI BIOS is pretty sparse. You can't customize voltages or do any kind of manual overclocking, but since the application does all that for you, and many gamers don't overclock their system because they think it might be too complicated or risky, this makes it easy to do so with a simple click of the turbo button or drop down menus in the application. Speaking of the BIOS, you're going to want to go into it (spam F2 when the laptop is powering on), and disable the annoying POST sound. By default, when you turn the laptop on, it plays a sound file that sounds like a jet engine firing up for some reason. I turned it off because I found it incredibly annoying, but I'm thankful the option to do that existed in the BIOS. Other than that, there isn't a whole lot of customization to do in the BIOS. It also has WiFi 6! It comes with 16GB of RAM (two @ 8GB) but the DIMMS are user serviceable so you can put 32GB (two 16GB) if you wanted to with no issues.

The OS comes per-configured somewhat, using performance metrics for the OS (such as not using the Aero theme). There is some bloatware which I recommend removing.
In terms of build quality...this is where the laptop starts to show its low price point. The entire laptop is made out of plastic, and it flexes really easily, especially the panel. The plastic trackpad is just OK, it will function for web browsing and light tasks but it's not that responsive overall. The two small cutouts for the sound underneath the laptop is a really bad design flaw I wish more laptop manufacturers would get away from. Please just include top facing speakers. The speakers themselves are already not great, so when they're shooting downwards it makes it even harder to hear some games even when the volume in game is at 100 and the operating system volume is also at 100. For this reason, you'll want headphones to go along with the laptop.
The ports available are:

Left side--Kensington lock, RJ45 ethernet, two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports, 3.5mm audio jack
Right side--Mini-displayport, HDMI, USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 port (gen 2 adds charging capabilities even when the laptop is powered off), and USB-C using 3.2 Gen 2.
Behind--Charging port. Kudos to Acer for putting the charging port in the center behind the laptop.

Acer rates the battery as being up to 6 hours, but don't expect to do heavy gaming on this laptop while you aren't plugged in. I got about 2 with some minor downtime between games.

One thing I want to talk about is the design of the laptop. It does look good, but I think Acer needs to think about the type of person buying this laptop. It's going to be mostly students who want a gaming laptop that they can also use to bring to class. I don't think that gaming laptops necessarily need to look like ""gaming laptops"". A more subtle design and the removal of any kind of LEDs on the exterior of the laptop would appeal to a much wider audience in my opinion.

Overall, this laptop is an incredible deal. For what you pay, you're getting an incredible capable gaming laptop",5,577,Graphics Description: RTX 2060Capacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook Only,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"June 27, 2020",United States
B08842D7JS,R3VW4OP80S4MP1,Mitchell,Best Gaming Computer 2020,"I bought this laptop as a last second mobile CAD workhorse (I'm an Engineering Technician). I did a TON of research on laptops close to the $1K mark that were also prime available on amazon. There are a few configurations of this laptop on Amazon, this being the entry level RTX version. So far, I've been blown away by the build quality and performance of this Helios 300. ACER has been my go-to for reliable computing for awhile now. Let's get to it:

PROS:

X2 M.2 slots for storage PLUS a SATA bay for even more
RGB zoned keyboard (and a great feeling one for gaming / everyday tasks)
BIG vents on rear and sides, PLENTY of intake area on bottom
The thing just looks awesome, props to the design team for making a gaming laptop that looks professional
Predator sense UI is clean, loads quickly, and easy to use
With ray tracing on I saw around 60 fps on COD war zone with settings maxed.

Not so much CONS:

Fans get loud under load, but they react quickly and bring temps down FAST. It's an RTX machine, what can I say?
Audio could be improved, especially BASS... but you've read this before with any laptop ad I know you'll be using headphones for games
Power connector is in the rear center, you have to account for hardware layout here however
BATTERY LIFE - probably the biggest complaint here, I would have absolutely spent an extra $100-$200 for better battery life if possible
STORAGE CAPACITY - Would have liked a configuration on Amazon with 1TB + of this amazing nvme SSD
Included case feels nice, but should have an extra pocket for the power brick (considering you'll almost always need it)

All in all a lot of this goes without saying, but what is worth repeating is that this computer has 100% exceeded my expectations. This is the laptop to get mid-late 2020 if you want a 10th gen Intel chip and RTX. Thank you ACER!",5,343,Graphics Description: RTX 2060Capacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook Only,Verified Purchase,"June 28, 2020",United States
B08842D7JS,R1QCVD02NU740C,G,Even better than last year’s model!!!,"If you’ve heard of the Helios 300 then you’ve heard it’s one of the best, if not the best price to performance machines you can get. For $1,200 you’re getting a beautiful 144hz/3ms 1080p display that’s very crisp and looks great. The aesthetics remain similar to last year’a model with the exception of the back vents look way more aggressive, very nice looking. It has in take slits above the keyboard for increased cooling. The 10th gen intel and rocking a 2060 or 2070max q depending on your configuration. Well, let me get to the meaty parts. Easily upgradable, non soldered ram, dual channel, WiFi 6 non soldered, two nvme slots and one 2.5 SSD slot. The cooling is PHENOMENAL. I was going to repaste but I wanted to see how it performed with factory paste. Well, the highest it reached was 91c and dropped down to 88c immediately. It was averaging 80-88c while gaming for over an hour(far cry 5 max settings). I will repaste just because I like tinkering with my stuff, but the average user not need worry about this. The GPU stays even cooler. Those intake slits they added above the keyboard makes all the difference. Let’s see what else... the sound is good, typical laptop speakers, use a headphone. The material feels very nice. It does not feel like a “budget” gaming laptop at all. In a sea of overpriced gaming laptops with similar or higher price tags, this one is truly the winner. Also, I know ryzen is great, and you’ll read all about “8 cores vs 6 cores maaaaan!” I went through 3 ryzen laptops. While the extra cores and threads were nice, they’re meaningless for gaming, especially when they run slower and hotter.",5,262,Graphics Description: RTX 2060Capacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook Only,Verified Purchase,"June 26, 2020",United States

I searched for a long time and have not seen another laptop with this price that was loaded like this. Every other laptop had something that made it not as good. When I got it, it exceeded my expectations. It's fast! It runs all of my games at the highest settings.

B08842D7JS,R2H26JB1UYR8W9,melodicmonster,"The product is great, but Predator support is awful","The product itself is great, but no technical specifications are provided (in-box or on their support site) for the additional M.2 slots or RAM compatibility for upgrades. I asked Predator support for information regarding max storage capacity for each M.2 slot because I found information saying that some models were only tested with 512GB drives, with some customers reporting 2TB drives as compatible. I was told that the maximum amount for each slot is only 256GB, which is clearly incorrect since this model comes with a 512GB drive. I also asked what speed each slot would run at when both are filled because some motherboards do not support two full-speed PCIe devices, such as the X570 Aorus Master in my desktop computer. I received no answer.

Edit: I took a chance and installed a 2TB 970 EVO Plus NVMe, a 1TB 970 EVO Plus NVMe, and 32GB HyperX Impact RAM @2933 MHz. Everything is running at full specs and I'm happy with the machine overall. In addition to the support issues and lack of technical documentation, battery life is another concern--even with the stock configuration, the battery lasts little more than 2 hours.",3,97,Graphics Description: RTX 2060Capacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook Only,Verified Purchase,"July 1, 2020",United States

B08842D7JS,R3MEBOQUOUK0QC,SCZ,Great budget gaming laptop,"After spending hours researching what laptop to get, I went with the Helios 300. It has good battery life, a super fast refresh rate and its specs looked really good for the price. The Predator sense app that it comes with is super useful as you can customize pretty much every aspect of the laptop. I only have small 2 problems with the laptop. The fans can get pretty loud at times but you can customize fan speed through the Predator Sense app and the other problem is that when playing games it will blow hot air onto your right hand. Not much of an actually problem but it’s different from my last laptop and something to get used to.

Benchmarks
CSGO - It plays csgo at 250-300 FPS on max settings and with the screen it plays amazing
LoL - once again 175-250 FPS on league at max
Rust - 70-90 FPS at graphics level 5. Plays much better than the last laptop I had!",5,36,Graphics Description: RTX 2060Capacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook Only,Verified Purchase,"June 29, 2020",United States
B08842D7JS,R10Z7PM8XSK2Y5,Nigel l,poor quality,"This laptop seemed to good to be true; which is exactly what it is. At such a good price with those specs I gave it a shot. It feels cheap. I returned it because the keyboard was not registering keyboard clicks very consistently. It runs EXTREMELY hot when playing games, even with the fans blasting as strong as they could (which are so incredibly loud by the way), it was consistent at 95 celsius, which is no good. Even if the keyboard worked for me, I would have returned this laptop as this is obviously not sustainable for long term use. I would look into spending a little bit more money for something with these same specs that is a little more well built. The extra money will be worth the investment to stay away from this machine.",1,30,Graphics Description: RTX 2060Capacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook Only,Verified Purchase,"July 15, 2020",United States
B08842D7JS,R26CZDW56Q9G5T,Clipped Wings,Prepare yourself for some configuration,"This is not reflective of the laptop itself, this is Microsoft being Microsoft. Your idle temperatures, out of the box, are going to rest as high as 70 to 80 degrees Celsius. Yes, you read that right. Windows 10 has implemented a protocol that uses only 2 of the 6 CPU's at rest, which for a PC works out fairly well but for a laptop is a thermal nightmare. Don't panic. A minor adjust of the max processor state from 100% to 99% should fix this issue and there are several YouTube videos out there that will show you how to do this. Make this the very first thing you do after you apply all the updates to the OS and video card. Second is switching the global setting in the NVIDIA control panel in 3D management from ""auto"" to ""NVIDIA preferred."" Third is to make sure you give those rear fans some room to breathe- I give them about 1.5 inches standoff from the resting surface.

These three things take about 90 seconds to do and they gave me idle temperatures of 39 degrees. Other sources will tell you to undervolt (these machines are factory undervolted by 0.125v) with ThrottleStop or UTX. It's up to you which route you take, but you absolutely must change the power management settings whether you choose to manually undervolt or not because Windows 10 will fry your machine if you don't.

Other than that, I'm super happy with this laptop and you're getting a ton of bang for your buck.",5,24,Graphics Description: RTX 2060Capacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook Only,Verified Purchase,"September 15, 2020",United States
B08842D7JS,R3BHR4N5DA1RCP,Joe,Good Price - Poor Quality Control - Terrible Acer Service,"I switched from a gaming desktop to this laptop since I am working from home now and trying to keep the officer clutter to a minimum.
The laptop is fast, the keyboard feels fine, and it ran games very well.
I was super impressed at first.
Then it started crashing - or going into sleep mode (Which I found online is super common)
The only way I could get it to resume was tilting the laptop on its side - which worked every single time.
This was happening about every 30 minutes or so.
Amazon customer service got me in touch with Acer who said they'd repair it for free since it was literally a day old...
After Acer had the laptop for over a month, they sent it back in a box with a single sheet of bubble wrap and a note that said ""united is functioning normal. Unit passed extended testing.""

I am currently typing this review on my desktop, as the laptop crashed within 20 minutes...

So while the laptop is a great price for the features, and works well when it is actually working... It's not worth the risk for me, as my business depends on me having a reliable computer. So i'll be sending it back for something better.",1,22,Graphics Description: RTX 2060Capacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook Only,Verified Purchase,"July 8, 2020",United States
B08842D7JS,R2D9ZLTYNZNLMN,OldnAchy,Would Be Great Except For ALL The BSODs!!,"I bought this laptop to replace an MSI 17"" laptop that had a broken hinge (2nd MSI with broken hinge!) and was just out of warranty. The specs for this laptop looked great for the price point and there were plenty of rave personal and professional reviews. I didn't buy it for gaming, but more for daily use and video rendering -- I record console and PC (desktop) gaming sessions, develop walk thru videos, and upload to YT.
Pros:
I really like the keyboard. Nice tactile feel and no clicking! Plenty of RGB options. I have mine set to all blue and the keys illuminate nicely regardless of room lighting.
The processor is fast! It boots quickly and most apps run smoothly and quickly, I haven't stressed it yet, but will explain why in ""Cons.""
It definitely is upgradeable (with some caveats).
Even with the smaller screen -- as indicated above this replaces a 17"" laptop -- resolution is good and it is easy on my poor old eyes.
It doesn't come with a lot of ""bloatware"" and The Predator Sense and Acer Care apps are very useful.
I was able to upgrade it with a 2GB hard drive and 32GB memory salvaged from my ""busted"" MSI laptop.

Cons:
It tends to run hot even with the usual internet browsing and Office apps. At some point i may get up the nerve to run a real stress test on it. Right now, using Predator Sense (lots of options there) I have the fan control set to automatic and cooler boost on. It is keeping the CPU temperature mostly in the 40's under light load. I also use it sitting on a cooler pad (I highly recommend getting one!) which I believe lowers the CPU and System temperatures a few degrees. The problem with cooler boost is that sometimes it won't stay set so I have gotten into the habit of checking for it when I first sign on.

The major ""Con"" is how Windows and drivers were loaded. Initially i got repeated BSODs (Kernel, IRQL, Bad Pool, etc,). I thought at first it was heat causing issues, because the first BSOD came when I was upgrading Windows to release 2004. I put it on the cooling pad and was successful on the second attempt. Then came BSOD after BSOD out of nowhere. At first I tried a reset and of course had to reload my purchased apps. That really didn't work because the BSODS kept coming. I went online looking for answers (the last BSOD was IRQL not plus or minus -- not sure of wording) which indicates a driver issue.

To make sure that it wasn't an issue with the expanded RAM and HDD install, I ran the Windows Memory Diagnostic app and CHKDSK on both the SSD and HDD with no problems encountered as the result of the tests.
Yet another BSOD popped up (another IRQL). At this point I was ready to pull the upgrades, do a total reset, and request a refund!!

Then I stumbled onto one user thread where the recommendation was to:
Memory diagnostic
CHKDSK
Clean install of Windows 10
Go to the ACER website and download and install the available drivers for this model (PH315-53)

which I did -- installing drivers was a real pain in the butt. Since then the laptop has been running fine with no BSODs but I am still keeping an eye to the refund/return window, because one more BSOD and this thing is going back!!!

Bottom line is I am a little wary about recommending the laptop. I may have just gotten one with a bad OS install, but that is a quality control issue. Regardless, if you purchase this I would recommend the final actions I took:

Windows Memory Diagnostic
CHKDSK (c: /F)
Clean windows install (it should still be activated)
Download the drivers from the ACER website
Download the Predator Sense and Acer Care apps (remember, the model is PH315-53).

Do these before loading your own apps and maybe you won't have the heartburn that I did before taking these steps.

If I begin having problems again I will update this review with the problem(s) and actions taken.

One final and important note. Most how to upgrade videos demonstrate with the 2018 model which is a bit different than this one. Mine came with the HDD cradle already installed and the HDD cable and install screws packaged in the box. To install the HDD you must first unscrew and remove the cradle (looks aluminum), secure the HDD to the cradle, plug the provided HDD cable into the HDD then reinstall the cradle into the driver bay. The screw positions are obvious. After that, lay the cable over the corner of the HDD, flip open the motherboard slot cover, plug the other end of the cable into the motherboard slot and close the slot cover. There is a guide to doing this on the ACER website.

There are 11 small screws that need to be removed from the bottom cover before removing it (2018 models have 10). Highly recommend using a small Philips Head screwdriver with a magnetized tip for this. You will need a pry tool to lift the cover. It does NOT easily come off. The spots to use are at the bottom of the back of the laptop below the silver trim which is just that -- do not try to lift the cover with the silver trim!! When the pry tool is used in the proper spot at the bottom corners at the back, the cover should then be easily removed. No user guide or video that I could find demonstrates how to do this!!

Good luck!

Update 10/01/2020.

The laptop has been stable since I did the clean install, reinstalled drivers from the ACER website and reinstalled my apps. No issues whatsoever. I am now thinking about installing a second ssd drive, moving my regular data files there and using my HDD as a video archive. Now that I have been through all of the above, I am confident that this upgrade will go smoothly. Not sure when for that but stay tuned.

Update 01/02/2021

The laptop is still stable and running well. I have done no further upgrading but don't think there will be an issue if I install a second SSD.

B08842D7JS,RU3Y1WZ50PSH0,Pascal Suissa,Highly recommended laptop!,"The laptop is very good and I’d say it’s worth a buy for the price it is, you’ll be getting a top notch laptop for probably the best price per specs.

The response time is really low under 9ms (3ms supposedly with the software), the keyboard is solid, thermals are pretty good, and the RTX 2060 can handle all games on high/ultra with ease. Battery is small in Wh so when gaming you’ll have maybe an hour to an hour and a half in battery. Idle about 4.

Out of the box, I noticed some screen bleed, you’ll probably get them since it’s an IPS screen and hopefully you’ll get lucky and get one with a low bleed. I’ve had an issue with the automatic fan mode which was revving 300 rpm up and down non stop (audibly annoying) so to resolve it I placed it on manual mode and set the speed to a constant speed. Bad software I guess.
Temperature of cpu while gaming were 75 max with gpu at 65 max. I’m sure everyone will have a different experience but in case you have a hot laptop, undervolt it starting at -100mv using throttle stop and limit turbo cores if needed.

Overall I recommend the computer and think that the price for build quality and parts is an incredible deal.",4,13,Graphics Description: RTX 2060Capacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook Only,Verified Purchase,"July 19, 2020",United States

When it's plugged in and I believe this is cause it's pulling more juice the fans ramp up and it gets a bit loud, but it's not too bad, obviously it gets louder in games aswell. Screen looks nice and colors aren't bad. When you're not plugged in do not expect 144 fps on games at max settings cause it does have to save power. The keyboard feels pretty nice and the LEDs in the keyboard have a auto shutoff mode (on by default) if you're not using it and you're just watching a video or something, I assume to save battery life. When you're plugged in, it's a i7 and a RTX 2060, quite frankly its a beast.

B08842D7JS,RV2R92ZSPEZRZ,Joe Ricciardi,Save Up For a Better Laptop," The graphics look great and the features are really nice on this. Unfortunately the games don't run well at all. Its just a case of pennywise dollar dumb. The great specs at an unbelievable price are legitimately to good to be true. Games run very choppy, even old ones like New Vegas are too much for this thing to handle. The stutter varies from tolerable to unplayable. The attached video is New Vegas being played on the laptop screen with High (not even Ultra) settings, VSync off and max frames.

I don't know if its something I'm doing wrong, but I've gone through 2 of these and neither has worked. Games play choppy on both the laptop and TV. I intended to use this with a TV so if I had to change rooms I could just carry the laptop. I have young children & I don't have the luxury of sitting in one location for long. The TVs are all 120hz 4k and should be able to handle this just fine.

Either way, 90% of my time with these were spent adjusting settings. My friends are all PC gamers and they had me share my screen while we attempted to adjust various resolution and performance settings. They were at a loss. I tried calling Amazon, who were extremely awesome about it, but they couldn't help much. So they tried Acer, who were the absolute worse. Based on Acer's level of support, I would never buy one of their products again. They wouldn't answer questions, they acted annoyed and they rushed us off the phone.

First started noticing during watching a movie, bleeding in the corners and some worse than other corners, it’s so noticeable that it’s hard to watch anything with black screens and in the dark as well, which is pretty much most shows and movies as you can see in the pictures the screen bleed is bad, so I returned this laptop, not sure if it’s just the defective one I got but it’s unbearable to look at on dark screen or areas, I may order another one to see if I get better luck because it’s a known issue but I think not everyone gets either that noticeable bleed and some lucky get none while others like me get horrible bleed.

B08842D7JS,RK4IENNR0DDN6,Amazon Customer,BSOD right out of the box,"Awesome specs but gave a BSOD after trying to install updates. Had a long annoying time troubleshooting before eventually reinstalling windows from a usb drive. This fixed all the issues I was having before. Probably has something to do with the preloaded software on this laptop. Before you update make sure you go through and delete all the unnecessary extras. This should be something the manufacturer should look into as I found through my reading that I’m not the only one experiencing this.

Other than that this thing runs all my games smoothly at high/ultra settings. Fans are loud and it runs a bit hot, but it’s a gaming laptop so I expected that.

This is a quality issue. I have never dropped it so there are no external damages or spills. Don't recommend this product. I bought the product twice. The first time I bought it, the built-in microphone was broken so I requested a refund and now this laptop only lasted 3 months. The first two months of using it were a great experience, I recommended it to friends and family which meant I helped Amazon sell two more of these laptops. Now regret it because if my friends and family experience the same issue then they think I'm lying to them or making a profit off them with this cheap junk. I contacted Amazon and Acer and they said the only thing they could is repair under the warranty. This made me feel even worse because if they repair it, I won't even know if the parts they replaced are used or new. I learned my lesson about repairing products. After repairing it, it would at most last 6 months then I would have to repair it again out of my own pocket. I asked if I could at least just get a 90% percent refund because I'm not a guy that looks for problems but they couldn't do it. I said even if you guys can refund it, can I please get an exchange because this issue with the laptop, is not something I caused but an issue with the quality. Amazon and Acer really let me down. They said the only option was to repair. I'm a loyal customer of Amazon and I buy off them really often. I couldn't believe that Amazon wanted me to talk to Acer myself and they couldn't do it.

B08842D7JS,R2Y5RMSR6YCEX0,Creolejazz,Great replacement for my gaming desktop PC,"Reviewing model PH315-53-72XD. I'm in my 60s and have been PC gaming since the late 1980's owning mostly Dell and Acer desktops through the years. Five years ago I built a desktop gaming PC. This is my first laptop of any kind.

I decided to replace my HUGE gaming desktop rig with a laptop so researched gaming laptops for about four months. I was about to go with a Lenovo Legion when I stumbled onto this Helios 300 on June 24 (2020). I thought the price ($1,199.99) had to be a mistake. Other systems with this video card, storage, and 10th gen i7 processor were running around $1500 minimum. A few more days of research and I started to find positive reviews that actually linked to this exact listing...so I bought it.

For my purposes, this laptop is perfect. I wanted to simply replace my gaming desktop with something I could connect my monitor, keyboard, mouse, and speakers to, then, when necessary, disconnect and take somewhere. So far, a month later, I couldn't be happier.

The other reviews are correct, the battery life is awful. I played Civilization VI (on highest graphic settings) and the battery went from 95% to 9% in about 48 minutes. But for me, that's not an issue as I always play plugged in. The battery does not deplete nearly as quickly if you're just surfing, emailing, etc., but if you're wanting a laptop that you can rarely plug in, this isn't it.

I wanted to purchase an extra power cord so that I could leave my main power cable plugged in under my desk at home, then have a second that I could take with me. That proved to be a challenge as ACER does not sell one (at least at the time of this writing, one month after purchase). Even when chatting with Acer Sales, they were mystified that they were unable to find one. Furthermore, I could not find one for sale anywhere.

A second chat session with Acer a week later turned me on to their accessory supplier, Capital Data. I contacted them and they were able to sell me an extra power kit...for $115 plus shipping. I paid it, as I really wanted the second power cable. But ouch. It took two weeks to arrive, but I now have my ""travel cable"".

You've no doubt read about the features and specs, etc., so I'll just say this. The desktop PC I built five years ago was still fast and functional. But this laptop is noticeably faster and quieter. Yes, the fans kick in when gaming heavily, but the noise is still not as loud as my desktop was. I love the startup speed, keyboard, screen, etc. When I'm not using my connected monitor, this laptop screen is really crisp and bright. The software tools Acer provides are great. You can customize many aspects of your machine.

The computer world changes fast so research is always a good idea, but for the price and time I purchased this, it was five stars. Have fun!",5,7,Graphics Description: RTX 2060Capacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook Only,Verified Purchase,"July 29, 2020",United States
B08842D7JS,R3SAWJR6EJ1TK1,Penfist,Acer has come a long way: it builds nice laptops now,"Acer Predator Helios 300 & Triton 500

I used to think of the Acer brand as cheap. After using both the Helios 300 and the Triton 500 side by side for several months, I no longer feel that way.

The high points of the Predator experience: solid gaming machines that also do a good job of handling other tasks I frequently engage in: video production, photography processing, and academic and essay writing.

The Helios 300 is the cheaper and thicker of the two machines (see photos). It is also much easier to upgrade, which almost everyone who buys this machine will need to do. Unless you only plan to install a half dozen games and then not do anything else with the machine, the included 512GB storage is inadequate. Luckily, both the 300 and the 500 come with additional M.2 storage slots. It was relatively simple to upgrade the 300, but upgrading the 500 involved removing the motherboard entirely and took quite a bit of time and some specialized tools. You can pay your local computer shop to do this for you. I would recommend budgeting for a 2TB M.2 drive to be your primary partition.

The screens are decent, although to be honest I cannot tell any difference between the 144MHz response time on the 300 and the 300MHz response time on the 500. They look exactly the same to my eyes with one exception - the 300 has zero stuck pixels but my 500 came with one stuck pixel. That is mildly irritating. Acer policy is up to two stuck pixels so be prepared for that possibility.

The 300 is about 30% thicker than the 500. That did not bother me in the slightest. Both keyboards feel identical - they are nice and snappy and I enjoy typing on them.

I do not like the gimmicky RGB on either. A lighted keyboard is nice in a dark room, but I have no use for rainbows and flashing blasts of color so I set both machines to solid blue.

Battery life is adequate, not great.

The 500 has Thunderbolt if that's important to you - it is not present on the 300.

Fan noise did not bother me on either unit but the fans will be audible if you are playing a graphics intensive game or doing video production. This is necessary to keep the units from overheating.

Acer has come a long way since I first used their products many years ago - they have really upped their engineering game. If you need an affordable multi-purpose laptop that does not require taking out a second mortgage the 300 and the 500 are both worth taking a look at. I would shell out a little extra for at least a 1TB hard drive, and if you can afford it, go with a 2TB.",4,4,Graphics Description: RTX 2060Capacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook Only,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"October 31, 2020",United States
B08842D7JS,R3DZBMYN5T71LI,KR4Q,Ray Tracing on CyberPunk no problem,"Edit: still good but some cons
I am running cyberpunk on ultra at 60fps but dlss is on so it’s not true ultra. Still looks good though. With some messing around I can get ray tracing on medium to run at 50-55fps, using dlss.

The keyboard..... is horrible. It’s not just mushy, it’s unresponsive and requires hard pushes. You’ll stop sprinting or dash (cyberpunk requires double tapping a movement key to dash) because the keyboard isn’t responding to your presses. You have to push down harder than you normally would. Looked into it and this is a common issue and a design flaw. Still enjoying the laptop and think it’s a tremendous value

Upgrading from my Alienware R3 1060 laptop just for cyberpunk and went with the Predator.

It’s great. I was disappointed that it doesn’t come with a Ryzen 4800h, but the i7 is still really strong. The 2060 is also really good. Running everything on ultra, including Cyberpunk, with high frame rates (over 60). There is a 2.5 bay and additional m.2 slot for extra storage. I added an Evo 860 ssd and it was simple though removing the bottom plate sucked. Watch a video on how to open it because you will want additional storage as 500gb isn’t enough. Everything about the laptop is solid. Great screen, can confirm is 144hz. Awesome performance, supports ray tracing. I know this is a budget entry level laptop but my last laptop I purchased was in 2016 and this feels high end to me. It performs on a level par with what I expect $2,500 laptop to perform at. The 3000 rtx cards are coming out and rumors of the new Navi cards so this might not be the best time to buy, but I really wanted to play cyberpunk so I got it and no regrets.",5,3,Graphics Description: RTX 2060Capacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook Only,Verified Purchase,"December 11, 2020",United States
B08842D7JS,ROK4TNSAVCNAT,James,its good and i like it a lot,"had it for several days now, it's a nice machine. runs my games very well.

everyone knows why they want this computer so I'm just gonna point out the cons which may make or break someones decision.

now these things don't bother me at all because I already did my research and knew what to expect,

-noticeable screen bleeding on a black screen, (you can see it in a dark room)
-this thing gets loud when the fans boost up (wooooosh)
-comes with a little bit of pre-installed software I didn't want (I kept some I found to be useful)
-not the easiest to get inside for upgrades (be careful and use the right tools)

as a side note, i would like to see laptops in this category with more peripheral ports.

p.s. i saw a couple popular YouTuber reviews of this 2020 model and noticed the m.2 storage slots came with heat shields. mine did not. I was slightly concerned but soon after I saw a review of this model from a YouTuber that purchased the machine himself and his also did not come with the ssd heat shields. I think maybe the higher end configurations may come with them or it could just be that those demo laptops Acer sent out to be reviewed had those extra components added.",5,5,Graphics Description: RTX 2060Capacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook Only,Verified Purchase,"July 6, 2020",United States
B08842D7JS,R1T6RF0B48TY9J,Sascoa,Don't buy - 5 solid reasons below,"The specs for the cost on this computer are okay, but there are just a few nagging problems I had with it that led to me returning it.

1. When you turn the computer on, it plays, at full volume, a cringe-inducing ""gamer start up"" noise - it will also play this when the computer restarts to update at 3am. Presumably it can be turned off in the bios, but who's idea was this? Who does it appeal to?

2. I can't speak for all units, but my computer constantly struggled with switching to the speakers sound input if the computer was using another audio device as output. Using a monitor, USB headset, or otherwise? I had to restart the computer every time or get errors whenever I tried playing media.

3. Computer has a ""turbo"" mode, which seems to apply some OCs or something along those lines. It also puts the fans up to 100 percent, which is deafening. In my experience, the turbo button just stopped working like 2 weeks in to using the laptop, which is a shame, because sometimes I would use it during gaming to level out the fan curve, which is audibly jittery as it tries to figure out if it should sit at 80, or 50, or 80, or 50, etc etc etc. The constant throttling is almost more annoying than keeping the fan at 100.

4. This is a problem I had years ago theast time I had a gaming laptop, and this seems no different: a lot of games, AAA, indie, you name it, will not run off of the dedicated GPU by default, and will instead (poorly) run on the integrated Intel GPU. To fix this you need to change the program's defaults from within the NVidia Control Panel.

5. This thing runs HOT. Running a game like Phasmophobia, which isnt exactly ""next gen"" makes the keyboard so hot that it hurts to use the B key to talk on global comms after a while, because there's clearly a major heat sink underneath it, possibly for the GPU or CPU.

If youre looking at this for a gaming computer, consider running a desktop. If you must go with a laptop, I'd look elsewhere, as questionable design decisions and downright bad ones make the experience here frustrating at best and broken at worst.",1,3,Graphics Description: RTX 2060Capacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook Only,Verified Purchase,"December 31, 2020",United States

B08842D7JS,R1EVBHGFZRH8LG,Mark,"GPU fan is horribly loud, even at low RPMs","A few reviewers have already mentioned it. The GPU fan is EXTREMELY distracting even at low RPMs. It makes a really high pitched whistling noise that drowns out game/music audio, making immersion into a story-driven game or movie impossible without good headphones. I’ve taken the bottom case off to view if anything was obstructing it (dust or what not), everything looks brand new with no signs of dirt/dust.

Read on forums that this is common with this model. Some people taped over the vents in the back to control the whistling, but I’m not going to risk damage from overheating by doing this. This model should be recalled and redesigned.

I’m also running it on an external fan pad on full speed, but the fans still insist on blowing at almost max speeds on games that could run on a potato. I fear that overheating damage is inevitable and imminent with this rig.

As far as running games, it can run the highest settings for any current game out right now, but your fans will be screaming when you launch it, and I just can’t focus on anything with the whistling.",2,3,Graphics Description: RTX 2060Capacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook Only,Verified Purchase,"December 30, 2020",United States

We contacted Acer Predator support and were informed we would need to ship it to them for repairs.

So, we sent the laptop in to Acer tech support where it has been since July 27th. There has been no correspondence from Acer Support regarding the repair or replacement. We wound up contacting them ourselves to get a status and were informed that a replacement part was backordered. None of this acceptable - either from Acer or from Amazon.

B08842D7JS,R1VDEQ9MY256FV,Simpleton Sir,Excellent Gaming Laptop,"This was my first gaming laptop or gaming computer purchase. Coming from an Xbox (Starting with Original Xbox) I can't believe what I was missing out on. Frame rates are excellent, speed is unparalleled, and access to games is just phenomenal. I'm extremely satisfied with this laptop. Side note: Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is the best deal in gaming and has made this purchase even better.

Graphically, the Helios 300 is such a jump above console and I'm assuming with the RTX 2060, a jump above a lot of other gaming computers for the price. So far every game has played flawlessly. I have synced an Xbox one controller both wirelessly and with a USB cable. I've also connected a ps3 controller via USB. The smart controls and built-in button options are awesome. I bought a Razer Essential wired mouse to go with the computer and have really liked the options and customization that came with it.

The screen with 144hz is simply incredible for a built-in screen. I intend to get a second monitor, but do not feel a rush for that. The 500gb hard drive has plenty of game space. I believe counting Warzone I have another 10 games with room to spare. The fan noise is completely acceptable given the impressive packaging, and thankfully it does an incredible job of keeping the temps very low. I have yet to need the turbo button at all. Every game runs on high settings at 1080p. Though adjusting some of the settings is extremely nice to boost FPS as you need to.

One downside is the battery, but in some ways, this is simply irrelevant, I get a couple of hours with lighter games like Age of Empires or even low graphic Rocket Arena. Honestly, though no one is going to play CoD or Apex on the go so this battery is not really a concern. The fact remains is that you get an i7-10 and an RTX 2060 for less than anyone else.

Build quality is very stout minus the screen and upper bezels - they are slightly flimsy, especially compared to my work Macbook Pro. However, the included case should keep it plenty safe should you take it on the go. Though it seems that most laptop gamers actually treat their laptops as stationary ""desktops"" rather than on the go machines.

I've enjoyed customizing the machine and adding all of the various game launches. Lots of free games to be had out there.

To wrap this up, I can't speak highly enough of this machine. As an entry point to PC Gaming, I feel like I jumped up into the good stuff right off the bat. The Predator Helios 300 is a great gaming PC that can easily hang with most desktop PCs. If you are coming from a console it's genuinely a night and day experience.

B08842D7JS,R2UCS8LENCBKLK,Amazon Customer,Great laptop but came with one glaring hardware issue.,"I love this laptop. This is my second predator. The first one (a GTX 1060 model) had tremendous heat issues and throttling. This has been solved on this new release. This is the new model 2060 RTX but is limited to 90 watts. I suppose a software update in the future will increase to 115 Watts. Either way, it is to my understanding that this would only provide a minimal increase in average frame rate at the expense of battery life. The laptop works beautifully with my oculus quest with various software options for gaming performance. The only issue I have experienced is hardware related (let me explain). When applying the smallest amount of pressure on the left palm-rest (where you plug your gaming headset), communication, (talking, not receiving) is muffled with static. After switching headsets and connecting with my other predator, I determined that there is a loose connection or metal touching metal that causes the problem. I called predator support and they recommended to get a new one delivered by amazon because delay's on repairing the problem could take 7-10 days. So I called and viola! A new laptop is arriving today! So again if you get this laptop check first if you can communicate through teamspeak and discord before installing additional programs. I believe this is manufacture issue and hopefully an isolated one. Again this is a great laptop with plenty of options for storage upgrade (2 NVME slots and an SSD slot with non-soldered Ram) which are found on more expensive laptops. Service support through amazon has thus far been excellent. I will provide an update if the issue with communication happens again.

I can watch even when the screen is at an angle. Acer has come a long way since 2007. That old laptop became a paperweight in less than a year, so I had my concerns.

B08842D7JS,RHC90NA8ROTOS,Sebastian Canedo,The close to perfect laptop!!!,"I have been looking for a gaming laptop for a long time. I wanted a laptop that was powerful, worth every dollar spent, and kept away from looking too much like a ""stereotypical gaming laptop"" ( my personal preference). Finding this laptop was close to what I was looking for! With so many pros outweighing the cons I recommend this laptop!

Pros:
-An absolutely beautiful design on the laptop. It keeps a perfect balance of a gamer look with the slightly sharp edges and the beautiful RGB custom keyboard but still likes to keep it simplistic and not too distracting in drastic design.
-The specs are top value for the amount of money you are putting in. I have spent lots of time looking at gaming laptops before and after I got this one and a lot does not compare in its value. I have tried looking everywhere in the competition of having a new 10th gen i7 core, 16gb of ram, 2060rtx graphics card, 512 GB SSD storage (with room to add an internal hard drive) and a 144hz screen for a similar price.
-For a gaming laptop, it is not too heavy to get around. Moving it from around my house or to a friend's house doesn't seem like a burden.
-Extremely fast when it comes to regular things such as surfing the internet, watching youtube/twitch, or accessing programs.
-The laptop is basically in complete silence while in use of regular activities. The only time it can get loud is on its own from demanding games or by your control if you are gaming for a good period of time and make the fans speed faster. The fans have the potential to get very loud from turning fast but it is all in the protection of your laptop.
-The predatorSense software and the turbo button is a welcomed addition to this laptop that has many ways for you to customize your laptops performance in how you want it run or take care of itself.

Cons
- The laptop is a fingerprint magnet that will show on the back of the laptop and also on/the space next to the touchpad. So I do recommend having a cloth to wipe it off.
-I am not sure if this is my own laptop's personal problem but the speakers when watching a video can turn out to
be too low in volume even though I turned up the max volume. Then sometimes the volume comparison it feels like it is where it is supposed to be.
- There is some backlight bleeding but not too much that you will recognize it all the time.

So if it wasn't obvious yet, I really like and approve of this laptop for anyone trying to get the best bang for their buck! I am happy to have this as my main laptop that will be running my work for college and my past time for gaming. The pros outdid the cons in my opinion and I kept myself from being biased but truthful in what I got. I will admit some of these cons were nitpicked but I tried not being ""that guy"" either.",4,4,Graphics Description: RTX 2060Capacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook Only,Verified Purchase,"July 18, 2020",United States

I decided to send it back in to Acer for repair while still under warranty. When I contact Acer to return the machine they gave me instructions on how to ship it but I was forced to pay shipping to their facility in Texas. No return kits or RMA's or anything. Then I waited 3 weeks while checking the ""Case Status"" page on their website with no advancement from ""Repair in progress"". I finally contact them via chat and they say they were waiting on a part to arrive to fix it. I said fine, but it would have been nice to receive some form of communication saying that. Instead of keeping me in the dark. Then I checked the status a couple days later and it was ""Suspended"". I contacted support again and they said it was irreparable and they would be replacing my machine. Again, I asked why there was no communication of this face. The agent said it had just been suspended at the end of the day do it probably didn't process in their system yet. I should get an email in 1-2 business days. I asked him to mark my case as urgent because it had been so long with no information. So I waited 2 more days with no contact and finally I initiated again asking about the replacement. They said my case was still suspended until they find the right replacement and that I would be notified via email when it shipped. I said yeah right, like all the other ZERO emails I had received. She said she would escalate my case so I would receive a phone call from the support team. I said it was supposed to have been escalated 2 days ago!

B08842D7JS,R3FOFWR8HKEFYP,Mark Peebles,what is with the bright lite logo???,"Still breaking in the gaming laptop but very happy with the purchase. The keyboard is a bit lazy on the shift key as I try to sprint. Soft key is the way I'd describe it, but this is simply my preference for keys that 'click'....

The cooling was improved when I put some wood under the backend of the laptop to raise the bottom 1/2"" so air gets is allowed to flow better. Initially with it laying flat it seemed to heat up too fast for simple gaming 7D2D, but now it stays really pretty cool.

The worst feature is the predator logo on the lid. When you lift the lid it lights up and there is no configuration to control that which is silly. I can control the keyboard lights in 4 groups, and I can turn off the SWOOSH sound that is supposed to be cool when you turn on the laptop. However, I cannot dim, change the color or simply turn off the light that is on the back of the lid when using the laptop.

My workaround is to tape the black note card which came with the documentation. The card color is black except for lettering of ""Predator"" and I tape it over the led logo on the lid. Hack, but it works to make the laptop not look like a game machine to my wife or if I take it into the office. I may have to buy a skin or put a real sticker over that later. Really silly that they could not update the config to control that light with 'off' and 'on'. Maybe someone will read this and do it!

The first one I purchased had an integrated video card and I wasn't able to use some advanced features of the editing software. I returned it and got this one with a dedicated video card and have no issues with using all software features. I also like the fact that I was able to add a couple of additional hard drives for photo storage and photo editing. I can also upgrade the ram if 16mb isn't enough, which isn't the case on all laptops. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars primarily for how noisy the fans can be if they ramp up. (noisy as in a whooshing air sound) I'm not too annoyed by it.... yet, and with what I use it for it only ramps up now and then. If you're gaming with headphones then you might not notice it. In the end I'd rather the laptop stay cool than overheat. It boots up in seconds and so far has been glitch free. I spent a lot of time looking at laptops for my specific needs and for the price, this one seems to be a good value for the features it has.

However, just as other reviewers posted, this laptop is extremely flawed in the keyboard design. Unless you hit dead center on the keys each and every time, most of your keystrokes will be missed on majority of the keys. This ended up being the most annoying issues I had. Constantly needing to fix typing mistakes/missed letters, ultimately drove me to return it.

Another item of concern was with the headphone jack not recognizing headsets when plugged in. Had to play the disconnect/reconnect game quite a few times before my headsets were recognized. I did have a few issues where people stated my headsets had a lot of static when speaking. Tested with a few different headset options and all had the same issue.

Overall, I do truly wish the issues weren't present as this is a solid buy.

B08842D7JS,R2RAU68GDCTWTE,Anonymous,Relatively inexpensive gaming laptop,"Great build quality, decent screen (could be brighter) with good viewing angles, good response and refresh rate. The webcam, and microphone are mediocre.

The keyboard is easy to type on and has a number pad, the backlighting is decent, and the track pad functions fairly well. Not a grease magnet, but not exactly resistant either. The cooling fans do their job.

Comes with mounting hardware and screws for a 2.5"" SSD, and an additional m.2 nvme SSD. The RAM is upgradeable, and not soldered to the motherboard. There are only two RAM slots.

I upgraded to 2x16GB of Kingston HyperX DDR4-2933 (CL 17-19-19-39 2T) which is running at specified speed, and in dual channel.

I also added an additional 2TB ADATA XPG SX8200 Pro NVME SSD. After enabling, and quickly formatting the drive in Windows -it's running flawlessly. That being said prying the bottom panel off after removing the screws was challenging. If you don't know what you're doing you can easily break the bottom panel trying to pry it off. Be careful, and take it slow. Start from the back cooling vents. You can find Youtube videos on how to disassemble a 2020 Acer Predator Helios 300. Watch, and pay attention.

Battery life is terrible. As in you might get an hour of use terrible. This is a somewhat lightweight desktop replacement, and something to setup in your hotel room plugged in while traveling. If you don't have a power source don't expect to use it much.

B08842D7JS,R33H1OXEX8DA7P,Astro,I Found a Fix to the Audio / Sound Disappearing!,"I've had a lot of issues with this laptop. From the very first day I got it, I was cursed with the audio disappearing after installing Windows Updates in a drivers compatibility glitch. I spent almost two weeks trying to fix it. I even called up Acer for help, but they essentially said it was a Windows OS glitch and outside of their scope. Ultimately, what fixed it, was uninstalling the Realtek Driver and immediately shutting down the laptop (do not restart it!). It's worked fine ever since then even after new updates.

That wasn't the only issue, however.

I'm not sure why this laptop is so perfect and terrible at the same time. Outside of these strange issues, everything runs perfectly. It's fast, has a great performance, and it plays games well! I installed a new HDD into the storage bay so I have plenty of space for games -- even if getting the casing off the laptop was more frustrating than it should have been. That could just be me, however, since it was my first time opening up a laptop. It worked wonderfully...

...up until I realized the Windows System Restore didn't want to work properly. As you can imagine, with the above issues caused by Windows Update, doing a System Restore was very necessary to keeping my audio until I found a better solution. (Thank you, Reddit, for solving my issue!) It took a good deal less time to fix that issues (just one day), but it still shouldn't have been something I struggled with for a new laptop.

Finally, a brand new External Harddrive also had compatibility issues with my laptop. It works perfectly fine on my desktop computer, but it's only on my new laptop that it doesn't let me transfer items. This could be the device itself, I'm not a master at computers by any means, but it's just weird that it all happened in the same cluster of days. If there were ever a series of red flags telling me to be careful, this would be it! I am STILL considering keeping the laptop, however.

Thanks to the Holidays, I have an extended period of time to consider if I want to keep this laptop or not. I'm going to see if the issues taper off here or if they continue to devolve into more dilemmas. Whether I decide to keep it or not depends on that. I'd rather get the issues out of the way upfront and be good for the next few years then have them happen AFTER there's nothing left I can do about it. I'll update this review again if anything interesting happens... but I couldn't resist explaining the audio fix (so easy and yet such a hassle to discover) when no one else here seems to know it. So, here's to hoping this helps someone in the future!",4,2,Graphics Description: RTX 2060Capacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook Only,Verified Purchase,"December 9, 2020",United States
B08842D7JS,R2FO4U0FCICNRE,BAJUNGADUSTIN,Best Laptop I have ever used / owned.,"This laptop is amazing. I was skeptical spending so much on a laptop but I am so glad that I did. Its fast and snappy. The bloatware is super minimal. Usually first thing I do when I get a new laptop is uninstall and reinstall windows to get rid of all the extra crap they throw in but I didnt feel that need on this laptop. The extra programs are actually all pretty useful.

The keyboard has a really nice feel to it and the track pad has all the gestures you would expect. I pinched zoom while typing this review to make it easier to see at a distance. The screen quality overall is FANTASTIC. IPS monitors are simply the best. No TN monitor in the world can compare.

Performance is great and overall temps stay down fairly well (see cons for more info). It got great performance on World of Warcraft and I actually felt like I could raid without being hindered by laptop performance since I usually play on my desktop.

It was able to run Cyberpunk on mid/high settings at around 40 FPS with ray tracing. Which is a lot for cyberpunk. 3090's were only pulling like 76 fps and my 2070 Super was able to get about 55fps with slightly higher settings and ray tracing. So 40 for a laptop with a 2060 is more than decent. Cyberpunk is probably a bad game to compare though really but I havent played very many AAA games on it honestly. I mostly got it for Warcraft and whatever else I felt like installing from steam. So far I have not ran into any real limitations from anything.

The RGB keyboard really stands out and is very nice. I have got several compliments on the keyboard alone from people who dont game or have laptops like this.

The Top lid feels just solid enough. you can easily open the lid without holding down the bottom portion of the laptop.

Pros:
-Fantastic Screen
-Great performance
-Track pad feels amazing
-100% silent when not gaming
-Useful built in applications
-Customizable Bios Splash screen that supports GIF's
-Dedicated Predator button to open the Predator sense app
-Light up Logo on the back
-Free Predator logo soft zip case protector
-Very good speakers and can easily push more volume than you will need
-Very low light bleed through on the bottom of the monitor. Can only see it during completely black screens and its barely there.
-Charger is designed to swivel on the back middle of the base of the laptop. Makes the charger feel very secure due to it being an L shaped connection but also makes you feel secure that you are not going to break the port moving it around. It also has a nice ""snap"" when you plug it in that lets you know its fully seated correctly. (Doesnt require you to press anything to release it)

CONS
-High temps the first week. I ordered new paste thinking I was going to need to put some custom paste on but before I even got it the temps seemed to even themselves out. Runs average 85c under load with a high of 91c and a resting temp between 48c and 62c

-Fairly Loud while gaming high end games
-No compartment openings on the bottom for easy ram and storage upgrades (can still be upgraded)
-Could have used 1 more USB port. It had 3 USB ports plus 1 USB-C port.
-No SD card slot. (I get it.. its a gaming PC but still. I would have liked it)
-Arrow keys take up a portion of the right shift buttons normal length. I believe this was done to save space but the shorter shift button means for the first couple of weeks I was hitting the Up Arrow instead of the shift. I got used to it though and I mostly use the left shift more than the right and that shift feels fine.

If you have any feelings like you think you may like this laptop.. Just get it. I have got 2 friends to get the same laptop already and they both love it. Neither have had any issues with it either. I also have not had a single crash or blue screen or the slightest hiccup in performance on anything.

B08842D7JS,R3GVPUE9O9QM2B,Karelia,Mostly a great laptop,"This is mostly a beastly machine. For the price, the specs are amazing and all run smooth and as expected.

The pros:
- The specs are obvious so I won't document those here - it is why most of us purchase this laptop.
- The screen is gorgeous and is something to mention. I did not get a system with any bleed issues, so I feel I should say I am lucky for that.
- It is not nearly as heavy as I anticipated it would be. The only thing that is heavy is the power supply. The laptop is easily transportable without the battery supply, however, this system requires that to go with since the charge does not last long.
- The fans are not nearly as loud as some document here in their lowest setting. Overclocking - yes, they are loud. But, what do you expect for a system built for this feature? Expect you can hear the fans.

The cons:
- The camera/video is awful. I do a lot of video recording as a musician in a now virtual performing world and it is so bad that I have had to buy an external camera to use instead. The video is grainy and the autofocus feature is terrible and ruins every video take I try for. I have updated all drivers and have tried troubleshooting this by all recommendations but the camera is simple bad. I may not have gotten this laptop if I knew the video quality was so poor since this is a feature I require. I am very disappointed with this since the laptop has everything built into it to have an amazing camera/video.
- Likewise, the microphone distorts if recording anything music related. I do have an external microphone for this already but the amount of distortion from the microphone is more than other systems I have used to record with.
- The Predator application that runs the fan and lighting control is bugged. This is an issue easily found on the Predator forums but without solution. If the computer goes to sleep mode and the quick power-up is enabled, the Predator application bugs and will not detect the gpu fan at all and does not detect the other fans accurately.
- As mentioned above the charging supply is what is heavy about the laptop, not necessarily the laptop itself.

It is a great laptop and pros/cons are all so individual. These are mine and I hope they help you with your decision making.",4,2,Graphics Description: RTX 2060Capacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook Only,Verified Purchase,"January 28, 2021",United States

B08842D7JS,R36ABUOP1OA59B,Jon C,Good quality laptop,"I finally decided on a replacement laptop for my broken Asus. As of now I am mostly happy with the purchase. I'm not really a gamer, but I bought this for use with heavy applications like photoshop, CAD drafting, and programming.

I haven't done a lot of heavy applications with this yet, but I am sure it will perform when needed.

My main con is the locaiton of the DEL key. most keyboards have it one the right most key above delete, but this one has the home key in that spot, so it is going take me some time to get used to the new key placement from standard keyboards. Not sure if I could switch this around in software or not.

The keyboard otherwise feels nice to type on. I didnt really need a multi color keyboard as pictured, but the software give s you the option to configure the zones to whatever you want, or turn it off completely. So mine is currently set to a solid blue which looks nice.

This laptop DOES NOT come with a touch screen, but i found that more of an annoyance on my old laptop with people touching my screen to discuss things, than helpful, so this isn't something i really miss.

I do wish it had a SD card reader, but I can use a usb reader for my photography needs.

The laptop does have good upgrading options, but it isnt the easiest thing to get in the back to do so. The back cover does not have individual compartments as some laptops do, and the cover is very tight. So, im going have to find a good tool to pry it open so i can add my extra ssd space without breaking anything.

Maybe the next generation computers, they can add this option. Its kind of silly to have all this upgradability without making it easy to do so.",4,One,Graphics Description: RTX 2060Capacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook Only,Verified Purchase,"November 10, 2020",United States
B08842D7JS,RHA26ETWG1PNZ,ThenTheresThisGuy,Great bang for the buck,"Bought this to replace an old Asus ""gaming"" laptop, after doing a bunch of research. The Helios 300 is not top-of-the-line, and I'd prefer an AMD CPU over Intel (whose lunch AMD is eating this generation), but I am not a l33t gamer and I could not get past the value offered by this machine. I upgraded it to 32GB RAM and threw in a 1TB WD Black and it's good to go. A fairly resource-intensive (and as-yet not well-optimized) game like 7 Days to Die is playing at 70-80 FPS on Ultra settings (no turbo or other overclocking shenanigans). They keyboard has three or four lighting zones, but never really played with them. You should never put a laptop literally on your lap, at least if it has vent holes on the bottom, but it's definitely a Bad Idea with this one. It gets uncomfortably hot on the bottom and unrestricted airflow is a must. Put it on a hard surface. I actually have shims lifting it up a bit at each foot, so there's a good 3/4"" space underneath it.

My only knocks are:

1) you have to remove the entire bottom panel (like 11 tiny screws) to upgrade memory or HD - there are no access panels
2) the headset/audio port & driver situation is...suboptimal. I had to go through a couple of iterations of driver updates/changes and deep setting alterations to get the headset mic to work properly and without conflict with the built-in laptop mic. It all worked out, but it would have been nice if it worked out of the box like the Asus did.

B08842D7JS,R1LG8KGA0CR9LZ,Bri,Best For A Budget Gamer,"If you're a semi to serious gamer that is in the need of a gaming laptop while also on a budget then look no further. The Predator Helios 300 is just right for you, the big brother to the Nitro5 and an amazing model.

First off, I picked this laptop for two main reasons, first the Nvidia GeForce GTX 2060. I wanted a GPU more powerful than the 1660TI's that most laptops around the $800-$1000 range have. I wanted the laptop for VR diving though so the GPU was most important to me. Second was the RAM, I wanted the 16GB model, not an 8GB model specifically. For VR mainly but also for most bigger games I felt that 16GB was needed. The CPU is also nice its the newer i7-10750H, id have been okay with the 9th gen but I am definitely pleased with the 10th gen. It is a powerful machine that will get the job done and can run any game I've tried to play with no problems. It only comes with around 500GB to start with but the device has slots in the back that you can use to upgrade the storage level easily as well you can easily upgrade the RAM. The upgradability is an amazing plus that really helped sell me on this laptop.

Some people have made complaints in reviews on amazon and on YouTube that I saw but to me none were any problem for me. Ill address the big one first, the battery life, if its not plugged and you're gaming id say you'll get around 3 hours before you need to plug it in. BUT THATS FAIR, this is a powerful machine acer tried to make as cheap as possible for us. The turbo and overclocking doesn't even work if its not plugged in so you'll probably always have it plugged in. Next thing I read in the reviews is the fans, and I'll admit they get pretty loud when in use they get pretty loud when on medium to full blast but again I see it as fair so the machine can cool itself. Plus you'll most likely have headphones on that will block out the sound. But overall the biggest and pretty much only flaw I have is I felt I needed to get a third party cooling pad cause I'm always worried about the CPU and GPU heat levels even if they stay in a safe-ish zone.

There's a lot of little features I could go into about this machine, lots of little things that make it really nice but that could make this review enormous. This is a laptop I would use for gaming mainly, as in I don't think I would stream with this though I'd bet you could. But the biggest thing I wanted to get across in my review is that if you're trying to avoid the $1500 laptop zones this is the machine for you.

B08842D7JS,R3NOY6TJ197YEN,Sheryl O.,Best in class,"Great Laptop, given the price, the internal hardware is top of the line at this price point. The Helios does seem to run fairly hot when playing new games (next Gen 2020+) on full settings and ray tracing, often up to 100°c which can be countered with custom fan speed mode or a cooling pad. Which is what makes the ""Predator Sense"" key useful as it controls fan speeds and monitors real time temperatures. I use it for Ableton Live with hardware plug-ins and Steam gaming for the most part and never experienced issues. Battery life is insubstantial when gaming, as to be expected.

This isn't Acer's fault, just my muscle memory.

I don't really care for the ""Predator"" key on the number key pad. The program it launches just is not useful enough to justify a dedicated key on the keypad - I'm not even sure it deserves a spot on the task bar. It is useful, but not something that is used often enough to deserve a ""quick launch"" spot, much less a dedicated key on the keyboard.

Acer includes some useful software with the default install, including CyberLink's PhotoDirector and PowerDirector, and a few other less useful programs that are easily uninstalled.

I upgraded my Predator to 32GB RAM and added a second 512MB SSD and used it and the original drive to make a 1TB primary drive with RAID 0. I also added a 1TB SSD secondary drive for general storage.

But just playing something simple like Fortnite on low graphics, would run fine but it would make the battery die within an hour. Just casual youtube surfing etc will last maybe 3 hours, but why would i buy this absolute beast of a laptop for just casual web browsing?

I think the nail in the coffin for me was that the 3.5mm headphone jack is NOT input and output, it is only output. Meaning, that if i plug my gaming headset in with its microphone attached to the earcup, it only sends sound to the headset, but doesnt recognize/recieve information from the microphone. The microphone doesnt even show up in the device manager but works fine on my phone and everything else.

So if you dont have a USB headset then youre screwed, and even then if you need more usb ports, you have to lug around a usb hub, and youre still limited to the power output of 1 usb port.

B08842D7JS,R13LACBVECQX0U,Mo Ghonim,"Solid deal, great for the price","I decided about a month researching and looking everyone to eventually end up buying this laptop, and so far it has be so worth it. I wanted a PC in the beginning, but after comparing the prices I realized that a gaming laptop would have similar performance provided good ventilation and at a similar price with the advantage of being mobile. I was looking at other laptop brands at the beginning but ended up preferring this Acer Helios 300 because the price is better for the same set of specs and Acer is renowned in the gaming community, this is my first gaming laptop and I'm really impressed of how far these are now! I can almost play any game I want on this laptop; which is great!
This model has two M.2 slots like last year's model, which is great, and I appreciate that they attached the screws and connector for the additional hard drive slot. My biggest disappointment though is that in last year's model there was an additional heat sink on the 2nd M.2 slot, which is not available in this NEWER one! The other thing is that the fans get really loud when at load and while gaming, and the laptop gets a little too hot sometimes too, but I don't think that's a deal breaker, I'm hoping this will get better in the winter. The camera and the battery life could be better, but at this level in gaming laptops I wouldn't really complain. I had a very positive experience with Amazon shipping this overseas to my brother and I got to try the laptop myself as well. Overall I think it's a solid deal.",4,One,Graphics Description: RTX 2060Capacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook Only,Verified Purchase,"October 16, 2020",United States

This thing is super fast and well load and perform games in max settings I use this as my desktop now with duel monitors for gaming and game development. I also bought 2 of these at the same time one for me and one for the wife. They perform very well. I have noticed some screen bleed on darker instances well gaming or watching a video. Battery life for a gaming laptop is well ok its a laptop and running games with a lot of power don't expect it to last long even with light duty work like surfing web videos and such don't expect more than 4 hours unplugged. Hard Drive space is ok but i would suggest upgrading it comes with the cables to upgrade the internal hard drive if you wanted i opted for using my external 2TB USB I already had.

This laptop has a smaller internal memory, and a newer CPU and graphics card but is more expensive. And my old laptop was 7 years old and failing somewhat but I wouldn't have replaced it yet if it hadn't been ruined by my grandson spilling apple juice on it. It has been an adjustment trying to get this computer outfitted with the software I was used to using and I'm still trying to get all I want and need. So those factors influence my rating of this computer. I look forward to being able to do VR once I buy the goggles and get the software; my older computer was not capable of VR. I also admit I don't know how to use some of the features of this computer so I need to learn how to use overclocking, for example.

B08842D7JS,R145AQIEJD8AXU,Shelia,Wow!!!,"This is the best laptop! I was looking at the MSI for 1300 on here and actually found this predator last minute. I'm glad i went with it. I can sit and play Destiny 2 and yeah, it gets warm, but once done, this thing cools off super fast even without having to turn the fan power to max in the predatorsense application. It does NOT work with the mobile app but that's ok. I used the Turbo boost on a large map when i noticed some slight glitching (i don't have that fast of net) and it helped power through the glitch and get everything back to normal on my end. Turbo boost is overclocking the gpu. What I noticed is that it has an integrated intel graphics for normal use and when you game or do something gpu extensive, the rtx kicks in and takes over. it's great.

I do recommend getting a lapdesk! This thing will burn your legs. The speakers are on bottom so sound through them is crap, but this is a gaming laptop and it's expected to use headphones with this laptop which makes the sound way better. The keys themselves sometimes get warm during extensive gaming with the RGB on as well.

B08842D7JS,R2YF0LJFXQMTCM,Tyler L.,"Great computer, good price. Simple.","I opened the computer and immediately loved how it looked. It is my first laptop for just me, but I know enough from using other peoples.
I love the backlit keyboard, and the little noise it makes when starting up. I also like the sleeve the computer comes with, it fits well. I love the mostly metal chassis, but fingerprints are very visable on it. But it still looks fantastic.

The laptop itself runs really well. I have found it to be fast, running well. It does limit itself when not plugged in, but for most of my purposes I am either in a place where I can plug it in or I don't need the extra power.

The turbo key is nice. A good thing to use when I need it for more intensive games.

The predator sense has been nice, with easy access to those things.

I have had occasional problems with USB, but I think at least most of it is the cords, as other USB devices haven't had the same problems.

The screen, speakers, microphone and camera have worked well for me, especially the screen.

The battery has been about 2-3 hours from fully charged to dead. But again, I'm typically in a place I can plug it in, so it hasn't been a problem for me.

I had to do many months of researching different aspects of computers and laptops. From CPU, GPU, more specifics about each, screen types, and so forth. I also read and watched any review about the computers I could find when I found one to consider further.
It seemed everytime I decided on a laptop I learned of a new thing that made me rethink it all again. I had decided on another computer which was moreexpensive, with some features better, others worse. But when shipping problems occurred, I was forced to rethink it.

Eventually I came upon this computer again, looked deeper into it, and decided to get it. I actually think this is better for me than the other one would have been.

So in conclusion, I quite like this computer, and would reccomend it.

B08842D7JS,R20US5IBVDCNXP,PJ Jr.,Great Gaming Laptop for the Money - but some issues,"I bought this laptop specifically to use with The Golf Club 2019 golf simulation package, which powers my home golf simulator (however it runs Gears Tactics and Wasteland 3 very well). It does everything I need and has some great features. I am a Mac user and the last Windows I used was Windows 7. Windows 10 is serviceable but still has bloatware installed and the default email client does not seem to work with gmail or yahoo - I do not have the patience to try and work through it at this point. For gaming the laptop is ""good"" especially for the money. This said I have had the laptop for about 8 weeks and it is clear after talking with Acer technical support that the battery is defective. Gaming it lasts less than 30 minutes and simply surfing the web at power saving settings the battery lasts an hour at best. My only option is to package the entire laptop up and send it to Texas, at my own expense (including risk for any damage that occurs during shipping), for repairs. This may require my hard drive to be erased which would also require me to go through an extensive machine code process to reinstall my golf simulation software (which is extremely expensive and has usage tied to a single machine). All of this is very disappointing for a laptop at this price point. My Apple MacBook Pro was only slightly more expensive and if something like this happened with Apple I would have a box for return shipped directly to me (at Apple's expense, not mine) for me to send the laptop back to them for repairs. Given that this is a battery issue alone, I would have at least expected an option to have them send me a new battery and do a self-repair / return - but that does not seem to be an option. Were it not for the battery issue this review would be a 4/5 or 5/5.

I couldn't be more pleased. It has ran everything I tossed at it so far. I added a 500 GB WD Black M2 and that was super easy.

Keys feel great, screen is great but I keep mine on an Asus monitor w mini display port connects, razer black widow keyboard and viper mini mouse. I study networking at school and have ran virtual machines off this computer as well. BTW when you disconnect external monitors, turn of the keyboard lighting and set the battery to power saver, you will get 6 or so hours of school type use out of this machine.

It's just been able to take everything I throw at it maxed out in 1080p so far. I don't really game at high fps. Anywhere between 30-60 is okay for me.

In that same light, it’s almost unplayable without headphones because you can’t hear anything over the fans. If you’re just using it as a regular laptop or do work on spreadsheets/db it’s great and if you’re editing some video it’s no problem on battery power alone.

I would definitely buy it again and it’s served my purpose to casually game but also do all the other things I need it to do.

The screen is bright and beautiful with no bleeding on the edges and is perfect for 1080p gaming. As far as temps go, I was get around 89-90 degrees c when playing AAA games, I bought a cooling pad and because the predator sucks air in from the bottom, it stays nice and cool now no matter what I'm playing. The RTX 2060 is a great GPU and the ray-tracing looks absolutely beautiful on games such as Control and Cyberpunk 2077. I would recommend getting an extra SSD and making sure to keep the inside and fans cleaned, otherwise temps will rise and it can get loud.

B08842D7JS,R11QA4Q2RHHRRV,eglou,Very satisfied with the performance and price of the laptop,"This is my very first gaming laptop. And im very satisfied with the performance and price point. First of all, i dont know what to expect until i got the laptop. I ask my friends that own a gaming laptop with different model and brand. And i also checked some reviews and personal experiences from different users. So im a bit excited, scared and hesitant to buy one. And after all the hesitations i decided to bought this gaming laptop because of so many positive reviews. I got the laptop yesterday and did the needed updates on the softwares and drivers. Uninstalled all i think are unnecessary apps. And then installed my games. My first impression on the laptop is very good. Its very slim for a gaming laptop and light too. Power adapter is smaller and lighter than what i expecting. Its a little bit bigger to a normal laptop charger. Regarding the performance its powerful enough to play all the new tripleA games today. I got the 10th gen i7 cpu and a 2060 graphics card, 16gb ram. All the games i installed in highest settings 1080p resolution, the average fps i get is 75 to 200 and they are trippleA games. The only downside of this laptop i guess is the battery. It only last for 4 hours in normal use (browsing, work related) not gaming. If gaming it for sure gonna be less than that. So do plug your power cord while you were gaming. So thats it. Ill update my review or not if i experience some issues with the laptop. One more thing. Thanks amazon for very fast delivery of the unit. In less than 48 hours i received my laptop. I can bring it to our outing today. Just in the right time.

Especially after testing the Helios 300 with the Valve Index. Keep in mind that you will need a mini-DP to DP adapter for the Valve index.

Guys, this laptop isn't just a gaming laptop. It will run Beat Saber at 144HZ at 100% resolution, no supersampling. You will need to set the game at 2x MSAA anti-aliasing and lower reflection, but after that expect smooth 144HZ with no hiccups. This is before I turned on Turbo Mode.

This can be lowered to 120HZ and you wont have to deal with alot of compromises. Beat Saber plays very well on this RTX2060 powered laptop, making this laptop the ideal entry-level laptop for VR enthusiast.

I mainly bought this laptop as my main streaming/video editing laptop with a side of games and VR Games on the go. My main PC has a Ryzen 5 3600 and a RTX 2070 Super.

B08842D7JS,R1PZRMQBI8FAVH,Aaron,Had quite the surprise when I unboxed the Predator Helios 300,"Wow, this unit was surprisingly sleek. I initially purchased an Alienware 51m from Dell a week ago because of a slickdeal that dropped the $3k msrp don to $1.5k. To my surprise, DELL was unable to deliver and cancelled my order after confirming a 3 week ship date. I was quite disappointed with Dell for getting my hopes up but I suppose the cancellation was a blessing in disguise. Although the 51m would have been a beast of a laptop, I was planning to use it as a stationary unit because the total unit weighed 14+ pounds, which would've given me my daily workout had I used it as my travel unit (gyms are closed so why not just lug around a squat rack of a laptop).
I was happy with my decision to immediately go about my search for a laptop with enough computing power to handle minesweeper, solitaire and heck even Maplestory. At least I hope, the ACER PREDATOR HELIOS 300 should be able to handle those demanding titles according to my intricate calculations, only time will tell. Aesthetically pleasing, the form factor of this laptop was impeccable. I enjoy watching it from every angle, all I needed was a black leather couch in the background and it would have been a perfect frame. So far the performance has been efficient aside from the shorter battery life when compared to my Nokia 3310, which is capable of handling Snake at any time of the day. Still, that is expected with such OP performance specs (on paper).

I've had it for a couple of weeks and I am very happy with my purchase. For ~$1300 cost you get an 10th gen i7 (with all its intended cores), a decent Nvidia 2060, and a 144Hz ips monitor. Finding all of this at that price is pretty rare.

I added a secondary HD before even turning it on. It was very easy and I was happy that they have both the platter HD bay and an additional M.2 for expansion. I am also happy with the size of this system, since it is a secondary computer I was happy to downsize to the 15"" but didn't feel like I lost anything. The loss of a pound over my last gaming laptop was also a nice perk. It is also much quieter than my last system.

I am very happy with this unit.

I think the considerations I'd put out there for anyone considering a gaming laptop I'd point out:
- It's a gaming laptop, there are always tradeoffs but the gap gets someone closer every generation.
- Gaming laptops are going to be noisy when playing games. This one is better than ones I've used previously. This one also has a loud startup noise, it can be disabled in bios.
- I gave it a 4 in battery life and weight but if I am rating comparatively to it's niche then it could as easily get a 5. You are going to trade off in money or features to improve it.

B08842D7JS,REF7T30NM4CJ3,Paul,Bring your own keyboard/mouse + cooling pad with this immediately if you plan on gaming.,"Pretty good so far. Have not really used to extensively but only gripes I have so far are:
1- the key detection is too low. meaning, I will either have to smack my keys every time I type a bit harder to get any coherence. Yes I know most of you will say ""But maybe you're just too used to your cherry mx!"" but it is not the case as I do not have this particular issue with my very crappy and mediocre work laptop. That has ghosting issues that result in words out of order, not alphabets missing altogether.
2- I know this is both a gripe and an acceptance but- heating issues are pretty severe. playing something low res like DRG (Deep Rock Galacic) should not boost up cpu/gpu to 95+. not to mention that due to this, even with a raised latop cooling fan beneath blowing air upwards, the heat vent as well as the right half of the chasis get way too hot. It almost gets too hot to touch keys like M and anything to the right of that when actually playing a ""Real"" AAA Game
3- the 2nd M2 slot is AWFUL in regards to design. it requires potentially breaking/pressing down on the usb bus in order to even install and when you do, the M2 ends up slightly bent. This is a terrible design flaw on top of how difficult it is to even open this up to install it. Not sure why this is- MSI (yes, even them) had this figured out 8+ years ago. I'd rather the laptop be a bit bigger/bulkier and have better cooling/drive bay space.

Performance and screen wise, it is pretty good so far outside of those outlined issues. we'll see how long it lasts.",4,One,Graphics Description: RTX 2060Capacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook Only,Verified Purchase,"November 14, 2020",United States

The fan is a bit noisy but otherwise it is a great laptop for gaming and general use. I got this so I wouldn't have to leave my main desktop on all the time and the fact that it only runs on SSD is awesome, really speeds things up. The screen quality is good, and the overall design of the laptop is really appealing. You are going to need to install or get an external SSD though, since this only comes with around 500GB of SSD. I put in a 1TB SSD I had lying around so it gave it a nice memory boost. The screen is a bit small for gaming, so if you have an external monitor I would recommend using that since you will be able to see much better. This laptop is currently 200 off the usual price, and for the graphics card and 10th gen i7 processor you get, that's pretty good on top of everything else.

I have yet to play a game that it can't handle smoothly on ultra settings, including but not limited to: theHunter, Witcher 3, KC:D, Assassin's Creed Origins, Battlefield V, etc. It is also great for animating, rendering, and video editing.

There are only a couple of very minor issues hardly worth mentioning. The material of the body shows fingerprints no matter how carefully you handle it, and they don't come off easily by wiping it down. There is a slight backlight bleedthrough when the screen is completely black. The PC can get quite hot when playing a graphically intensive game, which can be helped by using the ""Turbo"" setting, boosting fan speeds. Which comes to another minor issue in that the fans are very loud on Turbo, with speakers that can't quite outmatch that decibel level. I recommend wearing headphones if you plan on using the Turbo feature.

It runs super smooth, and is very quiet when doing easy work (especially if you undervolt, it comes undervolted by -100mV by default, I could undervolt by an extra -90mV). The ONLY downside I could find is the screen gamma levels. Dark tones fall too dark by default, so you have to adjust your gamma level up *significantly*. Also, rigid HDMI cable on the right falls right where you put the mouse, so you can hardly use the mouse while HDMI is plugged and you can't keep the cable plugged.

B08842D7JS,R11XGMZUF8O8GB,Person,"ya, pretty good at everything","from: computer science student playing fallout 4

Main issue: when I scroll with Microsoft OneNote and Word, there's odd lag and during that lag black lines go across the screen, showed up ~3 months after I bought this. It's terrible. Does not happen on monitors though, just the laptop screen.

like all gaming laptops, the battery is pretty small. unplug it at ~80%, and plug it in at ~20% to maximize the longevity of that tiny battery. Lasts like, I'm not sure maybe ~2.5 hours of on a full charge. the keys have more travel than I'd like on the keyboard, I also don't like that there's a gamer button for quick settings, and more function keys (the top row) that take space on the keyboard, so the shift key, the 0 key and the ctrl key are all in weird spots / weird sizes compared to my last laptop, I can't type as quickly but that's trivial. Also the screen doesn't have great color.

I also deep dove into system info, and found something ***I don't fully understand*** saying the screen is 144 hz only if using intel graphics, then falls to 60 hz if using the Nvidia card. I game using a 60 hz monitor so I can't tell.

SSD: very fast file transfer speeds, load times in games is pretty slow. that varies based on your Nvidia settings though. Happy with the ssd though.

It's really, really fast compared to my previous laptop which was a 6th gen intel i7. Coding environments load probably 10x faster than my last laptop. the difference btw this and a 4 year old laptop is insane. I really like the build, I think the whole thing looks really cool and everything feels good, has plenty of IO, the cooling system is top notch, moves tons of air. It doesn't get too loud, and it gets loud because its cooling system is better than non-gaming laptops, so you should get better long term health of the components in exchange for the noise. something to note is the fans turn on sometimes when the cpu isn't that hot, and they do make a little noise so expect the fans to come on if you're at the library and have chrome, youtube, word, and spotify open or something

GAMING: I play fallout 4, Nvidia optimizes its settings for me, the thing handles 4 hour sessions like a champ, load times suck *sometimes. Sometimes fallout 4 loads locations really, really fast, sometimes normal speed, and sometimes really, really slow. I can't find any variables making that happen so I think it's Fallouts weird code, and the laptops 16 gb of ram randomly starting to work together. Very weird. Also saw someone saying it can't handle fallout new vegas, no idea what they're doing but fallout 4 is way harder to handle and it nails that.

4 starts only because of the black line word/onenote issue. Unacceptable",4,Helpful,Graphics Description: RTX 2060Capacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook Only,Verified Purchase,"September 4, 2020",United States

However, that being said based on my experience and other reviews I think the quality control by Acer is subpar. While the laptop I received had no software issues, one of keys on the 10 key pad was not properly inspected. I first noticed this upon opening the laptop as it was visibly not seated correctly and was lopsided. I initially thought it was just not pressed into place all the way but found out it would not click into place either. So I removed the key and the under bracket to reveal that one of the pins attached to the frame for the key bracket was not properly raised into place. Therefore the key would not seat properly or press. Now I could have gone though all the hassle that others have written about to get it fixed, but time is a factor for me and I work in the IT industry so I fixed it myself. I would think for a laptop at this price point quality control would be better or if issues are common that customer service would be.

B08842D7JS,R2AIDE1UE7MHSL,Ali A.,Great specs at a relatively low price ~ Recommendable,"I have been using this laptop for the past two months.

This is the first non-Asus laptop I buy and I don't regret it. Although the build quality may not feel as premium as a mid-range Asus gaming laptop, it compensates with great hardware at a suspiciously cheap price. Overall, the laptop delivers what it promises, though I wonder how endurable this laptop is - not that I can really comment on that after two months.

Cons:
I have a few gripes with the design. I don't like how the mousepad is situated more on the left side of the laptop (which Acer seems to do with most of their products) nor do I like the idea of having the power adapter connecting to the rear of the laptop where the wire is more prone to melting, being behind the cooling vents. I would have also hoped for some sort of light to popup on the ""Caps Lock"" button to show it's turned on. The last design issue I have has to do with the number pad. I don't believe I've ever seen anyone use it, nor have I myself used it before, so why put it? Had it been removed, buttons like Tab, Caps lock and ~ wouldn't need to be shrunk. Typing is not an issue however, this is a purely aesthetic issue.

Another issue is the battery life being destroyed by Windows update. My battery life stooped from 6 hours to 3 hours after a windows update, followed by another 2 hour drop, after another update leaving me with a battery life of around 1 hour. Luckily, a windows update blocker along with deleting the previous windows update packages, brought my battery-life back to 3 hours which is acceptable for me.

Pros:
-Powerful hardware suited to demanding games
-Very fast
-A relatively decent cooling solution especially when compared to other laptops

I researched several laptops to find the right one for me, a mix of office style working and also great gaming. I ended up choosing this one and for me, it was a mistake. The laptop came, the setup was a piece of cake, it was powerful, great display, ran all the programs I used...and then it started acting up. A laptop is designed to move around with it, that's why it also runs on a battery. Apparently, the AC port on this one isn't made for that. After a couple days of unplugging it once a day for a couple hours, the laptop started to charge/discharge even though it was plugged in. It would beep incessantly, the screen would dim and brighten and unless I unplugged it and plugged it back in, it wouldn't stop. However, once I did the latter, it wouldn't last but a few minutes and would start again. After 35 days and a few tries at getting Acer to help me, they told me I'd have to send it back and they'd have it at least four weeks or more. THIS IS A BRAND NEW LAPTOP!! Finally, Amazon was kind enough to send me a replacement which, after about 15 days, started the same thing. After a lot of research, I learned that the AC port is only tacked in place and if you remove the back and work on it, you can get the AC port to behave as it should. Um...no, not on a brand new laptop. I could expect that after a year or two, but not after 15 days. So, I am returning this yet again and have found another from a different manufacturer that I'm hoping will work for me.

Pros:
Beautiful display
Great power for gaming
Good speakers

Cons:
Terrible AC port
NO fine tuning of keyboard or touchpad/what you see is what you get and they're both terrible
Terrible customer service

If you can get one that works, it's an awesome unit, but at this price point, these kinds of problems shouldn't exist.",3,Helpful,Graphics Description: RTX 2060Capacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook Only,Verified Purchase,"November 28, 2020",United States

Tiene unos puertos USB que te permiten cargar dispositivos a pesar de estar apagada la laptop, ésto lo veo más o menos, ya que casualmente en esos puertos conecté un teclado y debo desconectarlo pq queda encendido. El turbo funciona solo si está conectada a la corriente la laptop, me imagino que es por el consumo de energía, el sonido que emite los ventiladores en turbo es bastante alto, pero aceptable.
Como Contras:
El puerto USB-C no permite conectar un monitor, es lamentable, ya que tengo un HUB tipo C, y en él conecto el teclado, mouse y monitor, pero con ésta computadora no se puede, realicé la consulta directamente en Acer y me indicaron que éste modelo no lo permite. La computadora trae también un puerto Hdmi y un mini display, donde podemos conectar el monitor, claro que me gustaría en el puerto C, para tener todo integrado, ya que cuando tienes 2 laptos y un monitor, debes de estar movimiendo varios cables en vez de 1, por cierto en ese cambio, mi adaptador de Hdmi del monitor, terminó dañandose.
La laptop viene on Windows Home, por lo que al ser esa versión de Windows, no permite la Hypervistualización, lo cual te ayuda con ciertos programas, principalmente al emular.

B08842D7JS,R3S1RDK4GFJSQC,Anthony Lee,Powerful machine and great value,"I bought this computer to replace my MSI GS63VR, and I have to say, for the price, this computer is an absolute UNIT.

The first thing you will notice is the high quality packaging when you receive the Helios 300. It is a premium experience from the get go.

I am a premed student who likes to game a bit on the side, and the i7-10750H along with the RTX 2060 will not fail to impress you. I primarily play games like Escape from Tarkov and League of Legends. The RTX2060 is impressive and runs like a 1080 when overclocked

The thing I love the most about the computer is the cooling on it; the intake on the top on this years version was a fantastic idea, and in conjunction with the cooling pad i bought, temps stay in the high 70s to mid 80s under especially heavy load (like EFT on mostly ultra settings).

There is also plenty of room for upgrading, and the computer includes an HDD 2.5 upgrade kit if you want more storage. Easy to do if you watch a YouTube video and follow the instructions from Acer’s website.

When the laptop arrived, it worked flawlessly except for the headphone jack. To be specific, the device didn't come with the Realtek HD Audio Control Manager installed, the device failed to pick up any recording devices, my input device kept picking up my output sounds (I was using earbuds), and finally, there was a severe echo issue when in calls which really annoyed me. To fix this problem, I tried to reinstall the audio drivers and factory reset the device which didn't do anything. This lead to me ordering my first replacement. The replacement came relatively quickly but had THE EXACT SAME ISSUES AS THE FIRST ONE. This really annoyed me as the problems were even worse than the first laptop as it made extremely loud static noises when an audio device was plugged in. Even though I was extremely annoyed, I decided to give Acer another chance by ordering yet another replacement. The third replacement came in the mail and finally, it lacked the audio issues. However, it had problems with high temperatures. the idle CPU temperature was around 60 degrees celsius and when playing light games like Minecraft the temperatures exceeded 90 degrees celsius which is almost damaging. All in all, I am very disappointed with this Acer's quality control and will be getting a refund for this machine.

Fast forward to 2020 and this machine is EVEN BETTER! They managed to cram in all this tech that I think still makes it the best bang for your buck in 2020 for a mid-range laptop, but it's now lighter, slightly smaller frame, better cooling (which was a huge issue for the 2018 model) and better aesthetics.

Gaming does drain the battery when not plugged in but the power you need for the components is a no brainer. The RTX card is awesome. I bought Minecraft and Flight Simulator and when I enabled RTX in Minecraft it was crazy. I was a little worried when the default on most games I installed was medium to high.

My 4K TV can not even display the smoothness of this thing.

Gaming- You will have no problem running any of the games that you're thinking of. There are so many functions that come with this laptop that make it made for gaming. Seriously... you can game your heart away with this thing. Browsing/Editing- This laptop can handle having 10+ tabs opened in any browser of your choosing. If you need a laptop for gaming, but one that can also be liable for your research paper due tomorrow... This will do the job. And as for video or picture editing, I'd recommend an apple computer, but again... This laptop WILL do the trick. Aesthetic- Very nice looking laptop that comes with stickers and a fully customizable rgb keyboard. It definetly has the look of a beast of a system. Battery Life- The battery life is subpar in my opinion. It dies within a couple of hours, but luckily charges in 1. Noise & Cooling- The laptop is quite loud, especially when you're going full gamer mode. However, if you're doing some research or playing a lower needing game, the laptop will be silent. Just be warned... The laptop heats up very quickly when you game and it's plugged in. The fans definitely work and prevent overheating, just the charging area tends to get a little toasty. Not to mention, I use my laptop for 8+ hours a day and I'll admit the noise and heat isn't even that bad. Price- I'd definitely recommend BUILDING YOUR OWN PC for the price, but if you're truly set on a prebuilt laptop... This is the best one you'll find. I spent days looking and reviewing laptops, and this is by far the best one.

*Bonus*
Just some quick things to inform future customers. It is a rather heavy laptop, the keyboard is amazing and you don't have to worry about crumbs getting in, the touchpad kinda sucks, so get a mouse, when you first boot up the laptop some really loud intro thing always sounds and it gets annoying, and lastly, 144 frames for a laptop is seriously insane.

B08842D7JS,R74BKFF8JC7N3,Jason K,Strong gaming specs for a surprising price!,"I have to say that I was skeptical that I could find a gaming laptop that could provide strong enough specs to be a bit future proof for upcoming games while staying in a reasonable budget. Then I saw that this new version of the Helios 300 was coming out. I purchased it and so far I am more than satisfied.
This laptop takes every game I throw at it and runs it at top settings without flinching. The 2060 is strong enough to handle new games as well as VR gaming without any issues.
Battery life is not what you buy a gaming laptop for, but you can get 3-4 hours with minimal effort and more if you are willing to tone down performance to keep the 2060 quiet.
Being an older gamer, lights and such did not factor into my research, but I now find myself a fan of the RGB keyboard lighting and the customization makes it something any user will find pleasing.
I quickly upgraded this laptop to 32 GB of ram and an additional 1TB SSD in a matter of minutes once it arrived, but the standard specs are more than enough for the average user. Still the ability to easily upgrade and that Acer even provides screws and connectors shows they considered the needs of their user base.
Quality is what you expect from a larger manufacturer. Frame is solid and lightweight and fits well together. Screen brightness and light bleed are far better than expected in this price range normally.
I feel confident this laptop will keep me gaming solidly for a long time and the ability to upgrade key components is only going to extend that period. To me, the bang for the buck is a high mark and for a user looking for something that can handle your day to day work and quickly transition to a gaming experience will be extremely happy!",5,Helpful,Graphics Description: RTX 2060Capacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook Only,Verified Purchase,"July 14, 2020",United States

B08842D7JS,R3IBLENCLYCYAJ,Abner Rivera,La mejor laptop gaming que puedes comprar a este nivel de precio,"Primeramente aclaro que esta es mi primera computadora gaming y tengo 2 semanas usándola y hasta el momento solo puedo mencionar que es una pasada de increíble, te da un boost increíble en las tareas que realices hablando mas allá de tareas de ofimática, si es que deseas una computadora que te permita a demás de la parte del gaming realizar distintas tareas.

En el apartado de desempeño gaming no la he puesto aprueba con muchos juegos pero en los juegos que he podido probar, juegos con alto, medio y baja exigencia no defrauda y cumple con las expectativas y diría que las sobre pasa esas expectativas.

Calentamiento: Hasta el momento no he tenido problemas con el calentamiento de la laptop, rondando temperaturas muy aceptables y nada incomodas o preocupantes.

Ruido: Después de haber hablado del calentamiento también puedo mencionar el ruido de su ventilación, cuando se realizan tareas de poca y mediana exigencia no hay problemas muy silencioso, puede llegar a tener subidas en el ruido pero nada fuera de lo normal dependiendo lo que se realiza y la temperatura. Ya en modo turbo es donde si se nota bastante el ruido, llegando a escucharse a través del micrófono si esta activo siempre, pero con unos audífonos puestos y el sonido del juego no se percibe, pero las demás personas que estén cerca y al activar el micrófono si podrán percibirlo.

Pantalla: Como antes mencionado es mi primera computadora gaming y la pantalla en comparacion a otras computadoras mas normales que he tenido es casi abismal, excelente resolución, el brillo es muy bueno (lo manejo a la mitad sin necesidad de aumentar mas el brillo), sufre 'Backlight bleeding' pero considero que no a un nivel tan alto que llegue a arruinar la experiencia.

Como conclusión puedo agregar que es la mejor opción que pude escoger en el rango de precio en que se maneja esta laptop en concreto y la volvería a escoger sin pensarlo 2 veces.",5,Helpful,Graphics Description: RTX 2060Capacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook Only,Verified Purchase,"January 3, 2021",United States

I checked it out, and saw that it had a 10th gen Intel i7 cpu, Nvidia RTX, 16 GB RAM, and a 144hz monitor. For the price it was at, it seemed too good to be true! However, this laptop really just is awesome. It arrived extremely well packed and protected, and it also came with a simple case for the laptop to be carried in. After setting it up, it runs multiple games on the highest settings easily and beautifully, such as cooking simulator, overwatch, and Minecraft. My only gripe is the short battery life, but that is to be expected with gaming laptops. For what I spent ($1200) this is definitely the best laptop you can find for your gaming/recreational and educational needs.",5,One,Graphics Description: RTX 2060Capacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook Only,Verified Purchase,"July 29, 2020",United States
B08842D7JS,R2E95INRWOJA2K,Jeff,"I'm going to be honest, I'm doing this for a free mouse pad. But this computer is awesome.","I spent weeks researching computers to game on, considering almost every computer within the $900 - $1400 price range. And I am pleased to say that after many hours of researching and comparing, I have chosen this laptop. Not only does it have some of the greatest specs for the incredible price, but it is also intuitive and easy to use. The predator sense button on the keyboard allows you to monitor the fan speed, the memory usage, and the heat of the CPU, GPU, and system. For more control, it makes it easy to overclock the CPU, adjust fan speeds, and change the lighting of the keyboard.

Outside of the specs, the computer looks mediocre. The icon on the back lights up when in use, which may look silly in public. The back seems to be made of metal, but I noticed that fingerprints show up everywhere, even after a couple days of use. The trackpad is hard plastic, which is fine most of the time, but warm fingers have a tendency to hop a little, which you can notice when you drag your fingers across any hard plastic surface. The computer weighs a little heavy, but it's not a big a deal as most claim it to be. You probably shouldn't take it on a backpacking trip through the mountains, but it's not a cinder block.

This computer runs games really fast. All of the games I have played have hit max frame rates, even after I set all video settings to the max detail (which isn't a lot of games, because I spent all my money on the computer). There is a small backlight bleed on my computer's lower right, but I know that depends on the model. The video is excellent, to the point where I am playing games and randomly stop to think about how great it is.

Anyways, I really enjoy this computer. Good luck to everyone on an ongoing hunt for a new one.",5,Helpful,Graphics Description: RTX 2060Capacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook Only,Verified Purchase,"September 5, 2020",United States

It doesn't respond to being pressed on the corners of the keys so you will miss type constantly or mess things up while gaming since the way you've learned to type your entire life will be different with this keyboard.

Second thing is the heat build up on the charging when fans are going is insane. There is a turbo button on the laptop that makes the laptop fans sound like a jet engine and with this on, too long it feels like the charging block will catch on fire. This also happens when playing graphic intensive games for too long. THIS IS NOT A LAP GAMING MACHINE it will heat up to the point where the vents will feel like they are burning you.

B08842D7JS,R3EF4B7D2812PY,Bryan Peters,Impressed with the specs to cost ratio when I purchased and now with the performance through day 1,"I literally received my laptop this morning and spent the afternoon getting it setup and updated. Would have preferred less bloatware, but it wasn't too difficult to remove what I didn't want to keep. The PredatorSense software is pretty neat. I've never had the ability to monitor my CPU and GPU in this fashion. It's also very helpful for monitoring the internal temperatures. Speaking of the temperatures, the fans pretty loud when gaming. That's not too surprising given it's a gaming laptop, but it would be really nice if someone could develop quieter fans that still keep the CPU and GPU cool. I would also say it's worth investing in something to elevate the back of the laptop to increase airflow if you plan to sit it on a desk. The rubber pads on the bottom don't lift it hardly at all to allow more air to flow to the bottom of the laptop where vents are sitting. I'm not the biggest fan of the keyboard feel, but I attribute that to working off of a mechanical keyboard for the last 7 months that I absolutely love. I do appreciate that they fit a number pad into a 15.4"" laptop. The quick access buttons for Turbo mode and the PredatorSense application are a nice touch. There's honestly nothing wrong with the keyboard, but I just don't prefer that type of keyboard at this point. The display is also something that cannot be overlooked. It's impressive for a laptop that only cost $1200.00. It's a massive upgrade for me (haven't purchased a PC/Laptop or Monitor since 2011) and was certainly eye opening to see the difference a modern display makes in your gaming/streaming experience.

Performance is spectacular. It can handle a massive work load and the thermals are surprisingly great. The fans do get a bit loud when on max settings or turbo mode, however thankfully the fans don’t really bleed into the built in microphone so you can stream/record/be on video call without having the fans cause an annoyance. I haven’t done some benchmarking yet, however I’ve achieved some amazing fps on some pretty demanding titles, and not once have had to worry about the device overheating.

Very happy with the build quality as well. The keyboard is about as good as I’ve experience on a laptop. I’m glad Acer decided to move the power input to the back for the new 2020 model, as opposed to being on the left side.

Make sure you under volt it and do a clean install of Windows 10 to remove all the useless software Acer put it there. If possible, buy a cooling pad to keep it a few degrees cooler, and clean the fan once a month to prevent poor performance.

B08777BH1B,R1KT2JEZMGO2KW,Jeremy Lanas,Review after 1+ month of using the Acer Nitro 5 728C Variant.,"I almost bought a 2019 Lenovo Y540 but then I found this 728c variant of the Nitro 5. No other laptops had a 144hz display with an RTX 2060 and 16GB of RAM. I bet a turnoff for many is the smaller SSD storage. For me, I just spent ~$100 on 1TB of SSD. for a total payment of ~1.2k I feel very satisfied.

I am not a hardcore gamer. I only probably play 2-3hr sessions every other day if not like twice a week. I noticed that games like Valorant bring the CPU temp to an average of 75 Celsius. I can only imagine what happens if you play a higher demanding game like Warzone.

Fan noise is as I expected with a gaming laptop. when you game it is loud, but if you game with a headset you will not hear it and it is not detectable on your microphone. When you are using the laptop for everyday use, every now and then the fan will turn on but on the quietest setting to cool things but turns off after several minutes. I am getting used to it though.

As mentioned at the top, SSD storage is small in comparison to competitors' laptops. It will not be a problem if you play only some games, but if you play alot, I recommend getting an additional SSD. You can easily find SSDs between the $100-$150 range, just make sure you know or have a friend who knows how to properly install it.

The only reason why I give it 4 stars is because the battery life is very short. It does not deliver the 8 hours as described; more around 4 hours at most. I always play while plugged in. Playing unplugged will probably make the battery life even shorter! The only reason I noticed the shorter battery life was because I used a Macbook before this and their batteries last around 10 hours. I dream of the day that Acer rids of the 2.5” drive bay for a bigger battery :)

A game that's over ten years old, within ten minutes the cpu was at 90 degrees celcius, with the fans set on maximum. I tried undervolting the laptop, by .145 MHZ, this only decreased cpu temps by 5 degrees. I couldn't play any game, even a ten year old game, without the laptop trying to melt itself. That is awful.

B08777BH1B,RQ4E16MYD14IK,D. Weiss,Poor LCD Reponse Time on AN515-54-728C,"This review concerns the model AN515-54-728C with the 144Hz display, and may not necessarily apply to other models.

The LCD panel is model ""NCP004D"" from Panda. A reviewer at NotebookCheck tested that display panel, and found a Black to White response time of 16.8ms, and a White to Black response time of 13.2ms, for a round-trip total of 30ms. This means that despite being 144Hz, the time it takes for the pixels to fade in and out makes it look no better than a 60FPS display. While testing a scrolling image, 72 FPS and 144 FPS looked indistinguishable, as well as 60FPS and 120FPS looking indistinguishable as well.
The AN515-44-R5FT also has the same LCD panel, and I was only able to discover this information by reading reviews of that product.
There's also some backlight bleed, but it's only noticeable in a dark room with a dark screen. The backlight bleed was not annoying enough to be a problem.
Additionally, the display is only 6-bit color, not 8-bit.

Aside from the disappointing LCD screen, it has great components inside.

The i7-9750H CPU is very nice and fast, and mine was able to stably undervolt to -150mV. Every CPU is different, not all CPUs will be able to reach the same undervolt and run stable.
When running all cores full speed, it had a VID of 0.86V, speed of 2.28GHz, and a temperature of 71C. When undervolted, the VID fell to 0.8V, and speed rose to 2.76GHz.
When running one core at full speed, it had a VID of 1.2V, speed of 3.9GHz, and temperature of 92C. When undervolted, the VID went to 1.15V, Speed went to 4.3GHz, and Temperature went to 87C.
Multicore performance was power throttled, and Single core performance was Heat or Power throttled. Undervolting eliminated the Heat/Power throttle on single core performance, and reduced the power throttle on multicore performance, allowing a higher clock speed. Huge benefit from undervolting here.

The SSD is a real speed demon. Despite being only 256GB large, it read at 1077 MB/sec, and wrote at 671 MB/sec (372 MB/sec sustained).
The touchpad is okay, it's less laggy than one I previously had on a Dell laptop.
The keyboard has dark red key caps that are difficult to read. With every laptop having a different layout for where to place Insert/Delete/Home/End/PageUp/PageDown keys, you'd need to read the keyboard to find those keys. Having those in dark red makes it hard to find such keys.
Additionally, the Volume keys need two hands to press, as the Fn Key and the Up/Down keys are too far apart that you can't reach them with one hand.
My old laptop had keys arranged as ""Insert, Delete, Page Up, Page Down, Home, End"", while this laptop has them arranged as ""Delete, Home, Page Up, Page Down, End, Power"". I use Home and End a lot, so I keep reaching in the wrong place to try to press those keys. I had to disable the Power key, because I kept hitting it otherwise. I could get used to a different keyboard layout over time, it would just take a while.
Aside from those issues, the keyboard has a very good feel. There is plenty of travel distance, making it satisfying to type, and all keys on my product worked fine.
I had extremely low expectations for the speakers, but was surprised when I heard them. Bass notes under 100hz are actually audible on this model. Very quiet, but audible. I bet audio quality could be improved further with proper calibration.
The USB ports and Power port were very tight, and required greater than usual force to insert the power adapter, or insert a USB device, they also made somewhat crunchy noises.

All in all, I say very good computer, but bad screen.",3,71,CPU: Intel Core i7 9th GenCapacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook only,Verified Purchase,"July 20, 2020",United States
B08777BH1B,RQ4CP7F75HPPV,John Campbell,Excellent Laptop - Incredibly Fast,"First thing that I did was upgrade the main M.2 NVMe 256 gb Drive to a Samsung NVME Drive (970) and added a 2nd M.2 NVMe Drive. I also upgraded it to 32 GB of RAM (wish it supported more)... I also upgraded to Windows 10 PRO (I preserved the old drive never run, so when if I ever sell it, it has factory everything). Very very fast boot up and runs great.... There was just 1 Glitch.... When I went to Activate Windows, it would not activate on WIFI... Tried several times and there were no connectivity issues with the WIFI, however, I finally connected to Ethernet via CAT 5 cable and it activated the first time, so if you experience issues simply use a CAT 5 connection.

I really like the Background Lighting on they Keyboard... The Blue Tooth works great. Have a Bluetooth Mouse to save the extra USB port. The USB 3 Ports are very fast. Installed full copy of windows 10 in about 10 minutes and the unit with the NVMe drive boots to windows almost faster than you can see it. Very reliable and quite operation. The screen is very high quality and at 144 Hz has no flicker that I can see and is very comfortable to look at.

Every unit has its downside... In this case it is hard to figure that one out. The worst part is the Power Supply brick is much larger and heavier than expected... But then again, being an IC Processor with an NVidia 2060, I guess it needs all it can get... With all that processor power and Video Card the computer cooling system works great, and the laptop actually runs much cooler than expected.

I highly recommend this laptop... Very quite operation... With 2 Fans and you cannot hear it at all. This is the Best laptop that I have ever owned.",5,58,CPU: Intel Core i7 9th GenCapacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook only,Verified Purchase,"August 7, 2020",United States
B08777BH1B,RT1UQ9BXUD267,sheila,"Heats up too much, heat forces gpu and cpu to underclock, and battery is TERRIBLE.","I get it, laptops dont have a long battery life under gaming, thats fine. But this laptop has a very, VERY small battery compared to others. Give you an idea, at max gaming potential and at max load playing a game this laptop will last just 30ish minutes before it dies from full battery. Now at lowest settings, lowest brightness, and lowest EVERYTHING it lasts 5 hours tops. This is unacceptable, a battery is not supposed to last such a short period. If you run this at normal settings and just play a video at normal brightness, youd be lucky to get 2-3 hours out of this laptop. Also, if its running on battery it will STUTTER. Stutter while playing videos, movies, anything, even under very low load and this is due to the underclocking of the cpu.

Then there is heat, it will reach 85c on both gpu and cpu after just an hour of gaming. This is with a lap fan put on it. This will force the cpu and gpu to run at just 50 PERCENT of its maximum potential. You arent paying for a 2060 (Mobile) gpu and a I7 cpu. You are paying for HALF of its potential. HALF. It runs pretty decently GPU wise due to it not heating up nearly as much as the CPU but I still cant run games nearly as well as I can on my desktop even though my desktop has literally the SAME specs as this laptop. It runs at about half of my desktop. The CPU is the main problem with heat, the GPU actually runs pretty well. Keep in mind, I have done absolutely everything to mitigate heat. I spent 60 on a laptop pad, another 50 on a ventilator for the laptops intake system, and it still overheats!

Its completely useless to have a powerful laptop if its heating cannot be sufficiently mitigated. I'm surprised not a single person noticed that this laptop is being heavily underclocked when you play anything.

Im going to spend an extra 350 bucks on a 1400 dollar MSI GL65 which has a 2070 mobile and a CPU that runs cooler in it. The reviews for this laptop is GREAT! People say it has the best heating mitigation they seen and I believe it which also improves its GPU and CPU substantially by keeping it from underclocking. Also, the battery is BAD on it but thats fine, the battery lasts only twice the amount of this battery but again, its TWICE the amount. So if you play games on the MSI GL65 it will last about an hour instead of just 30 mins.

If you want a laptop that is within the 1k price range I would recommend a 1660 TI with a powerful heat dissipation. Dont be dissuaded, a 2060 on a laptop IS NOT AN ACTUAL 2060! Its a 2060 MOBILE. This means it runs at about 50 percent of an actual 2060 on a benchmark website and this is often due to heat not being managed properly. A 1060 TI is actually much weaker than a 2060 mobile but due to it producing much less heat and being much more efficient, it actually runs almost the exact same as a 2060 mobile.

Now keep in mind I contacted them about the battery stuttering and the heat problems and they said they couldn't do anything. If I receive actual help with how to mitigate this heat without sacrificing so much power then Id gladly keep it but its completely useless to have such a powerful laptop when I cant even use its full hardware potential due to bad heat dissipation.

I really wanted to keep this laptop and if they can find a way for me to keep it and make it work well then Ill gladly change my review to something better.",2,43,CPU: Intel Core i7 9th GenCapacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook only,Verified Purchase,"August 8, 2020",United States

B08777BH1B,RD9YAO7EHS26L,ERNESTO,"Acer Nitro 5, Core i7-9750H, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060,AMAZING","I really would like to recommend this laptop to gamers on a budget that are looking for a gaming computer, it honestly seems to be an amazing value for the performance that it has. The RTX 2060 is really fast for almost every game, I was able to play Cyberpunk 2077 in high settings and 1080p without a problem with super smooth frame rates, and with RTX on and some settings to ultra I got close to 30 frames per second to 50, depending on the scene, so yeah this is an amazing and very capable gaming laptop. This computer is mostly for 1080p gaming, and should perform amazingly at this resolution, it is capable of 4K to an external monitor but expect Xbox series S like performance at 4K in games.

The I7 is fast and with the SSD you get incredible loading speeds. The SSD only comes with 250 gigabytes but if you have an external USB hard drive you can install your games there and run them without the need of spending more money, GOG and Steam work this way without a problem. The 16 gigabyte ram is very good, installed in dual channel so it works fast, you can run your monitor in 60hz or 144hz, the image is nice and very sharp, with nice colors to it, but it does have some white bleeding on very dark scenes, personally I think is ok considering how fast the monitor is and how good the colors and sharpness looks, besides this is a budget laptop.

The dual fans are ideal for cooling, I recommend setting the fans speed to max when gaming on demanding games, the fans do make some loud noises but it’s expected for a laptop with this much power and this small form factor, you can customize your fan speeds to your preference, I personally recommend a cooling base that has heavy ventilation when gaming to increase the longevity of the internal components. The backlight keyboard is red with different dimming levels, you can disable the auto turn off within the Nitrosense app and keep it lit indefinitely. The keyboard I personally find it very comfortable, it clicks nice and does not make too much noise, it feels like a quality keyboard all around. The mouse pad seems nice, does not have a back light but worked well, the Bluetooth seems to be very nice, I don’t seem to notice any lag when using my portable Sony speaker with this laptop, and the sound is very nice and clean.

The frame and body are made of plastic, it does bend a little but I haven’t had any issues with it, it will probably last easily 3 years if taken care properly, I really like the combination of black and red it definitely stands out. The sound of the speakers is just average; I really recommend using some Bluetooth speakers that have heavy bass instead of the stock ones.

For anyone wanting an amazing budget laptop I really recommend this Nitro 5 version, it has the right level of performance and you can’t go wrong in gaming with an Intel and Nvidia combination, yes the computer is made of plastic completely but the internal components and the performance that you get is really a great value at this time. I found very useful the option in the Nvidia control panel that lets you use your GPU on specific programs, like Excel, PowerPoint or internet browsers, further speeding up your aps and your performance when using it for Home office work, overall I’m very satisfied with this purchase.",5,20,CPU: Intel Core i7 9th GenCapacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook only,Verified Purchase,"December 10, 2020",United States

1. There is no service manual. Not a big deal if the forums have answers to your questions.

2. The track pad is finicky as hell. It works but struggles picking up taps mostly and some motion. Some times it has a bad delay thought not often.

All in all, I would recommend this product and I would buy it again. The price is worth it.

Update - 9/7/20
Finally got around to playing some games.

The game play is perfect. No complaints AT ALL for it being a laptop. Infact I am a little impressed and I don't impress easily.

The only complaint I have is how hot the laptop gets when playing with max GFX setting. Almost to hot to touch the WASD without some minor discomfort. (In this case I was: Streaming, recording, YouTube music, VoIP, and Call of Duty: Warzone on max settings. All at the same time for about 4 hours straight.)

Though this doesn't really bother me as I only use my laptop with this setup once per week and so far it only gets this hot when running multiple screens and lots of app/game combinations.

Also I prefer to use a second mouse and keyboard rather than the one on the laptop for gaming so I am pulling my gaming keyboard out of storage asap.

If I was to recommend one thing to buy with this laptop, it would be a laptop cooling stand with fans.

B08777BH1B,R3JU23FVK8SLOE,bt,Read Me: If you intend to use with Occulus,"I buy a lot of laptops and I’ve had a lot of success with Acer laptops in general. They really do deliver a great laptop at an excellent price point. Over the years, I’ve bought practically every other brand of laptop (Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, IBM, MSI, Toshiba) and the only two brands that have consistently met my expectations have been Toshiba and Acer. And of the two, Acer consistently has more to offer at a better price point.

This Nitro 5 (I own the 15” and 17” versions) is rock solid as a gaming computer. The default settings do throttle performance to a pathetic 30 FPS in games IF UNPLUGGED but this can be disabled at the cost of battery performance in the GPU and windows settings. If plugged in, however, I’m getting 100+ frames per second in all games I’ve tried at high settings. The throttling is actually a good feature as high end graphics require a lot of power consumption but I would have liked to have gotten a notification to let me know this was the cause of the drop in frame rate (and a feature rather than a bug).

The only downside of this laptop is that the USB-C port is a USB 3.2 port and does NOT support Thunderbolt. It also doesn’t have a DisplayPort (only HDMI). This means if you plan to use this device for VR, the Occulus Rift 2 is incompatible even though the graphics card is well within spec. HOWEVER, the original Rift (which uses HDMI) will work as will the Occulus Quest. So if you’re wondering if this is VR Ready, it is but keep in mind that there’s an asterisk here depending on the headset.

B08777BH1B,R1422UI5812L1M,Eric,"Audio jack issues, gets REAL hot (Updated 12/28/20)","UPDATE - 12/28/20 (Original Review after the update)
Ok, due to the scarcity of laptops due to everyone working from home because of the Great Dumpster Fire of 2020, I decided to keep the laptop - I got a USB audio adapter to compensate for the audio jack issue (see below) and, while it works, it blocks the second USB port on the laptop (of course.)

Aside from the audio jack issue, there are some other problems with this laptop. First of all, the power input is placed square in the middle of the right side of the laptop. If you have limited space (I'm moving, so my desk is in storage and I'm using a tray table,) the cord and plug do get in the way. It's dumb design, but I really can't cite it as being a deal-breaker, since it really won't affect many people.

That being said, the CPU on this laptop will immediately crank into overdrive and get VERY HOT, to the point where I was worrying if the thing would burn itself out in a few months of light usage. When playing a five year old game (Blood Bowl 2,) the CPU would immediately go into Turbo (4.5 GHZ) from the base frequency (2.6 GHZ) and stay there - as far as I know, the Turbo should only be a quick burst if the CPU needs the extra processing speed for some reason, not an ""always on"" feature. Running at full speed, the CPU would shoot up to around 100 degrees C (212 F!!!) I lowered the voltage to the CPU to 95% and it didn't make a whole lot of difference and I would still be in the 95 degree-ish range.

This was really concerning, so before I returned the laptop, I looked around and people were saying that the thermal paste was improperly applied to the chips and that you could reduce the heat significantly by cleaning out the old stuff and applying new. I bought some Arctic MX-4 and took the case apart (YouTube it) and hoo boy, it was a mess under the heatsinks. It looked like someone had squirted chewing gum in there and slapped the heatsinks down. ASUS QC is apparently terrible to have allowed that kind of garbage. It took forever to clean out, but once it was done, I applied the Arctic MX-4 and reassembled the laptop.

I IMMEDIATELY noticed a temperature drop, and bumped the CPU back up to 100% - it still cranked away in Turbo, so I don't know if something is faulty. Not wanting to damage the chip over the long term, I bumped it back down to 99% and the CPU runs at between 65-70 degrees C (149-158 F) CONSISTENTLY while playing BB2. I didn't monitor the GPU prior to the paste application, but it doesn't run hotter than the CPU at any point. Note that I have not run any stress tests on the laptop, so I can't speak to that or processor intensive games.

Long story short, my original one-star review stands - there are too many issues with this laptop to make it a worthwhile purchase. IF you get it for a phenomenal price and are comfortable getting in and replacing the thermal paste, it MIGHT be an alright deal for you. Otherwise, avoid this laptop and get something else - I understand that the Ryzen 7 chips run cooler, so that might be a better option, especially if you get a non-ASUS unit.

==============================

ORIGINAL REVIEW - Apparently a common problem with Acer laptops, and this Nitro being no exception, is the fact that headsets with mics often will not work when plugged into the analog audio jack. I did my research on my laptop purchase, and decided to roll the dice, and, unfortunately, was burned.

I tried for hours to get multiple analog headsets, as well as a standard phone with mic headset working with this laptop and was unable to do so. The headsets all work, as I am able to use them on my Windows 10 desktop, but the mic will not register on the laptop. I've uninstalled the drivers and tried to install new ones, but was unsuccessful. The best I could get was when I would conduct a speaker test, the mic would also test at the same level, leading me to believe that the analog jack is incorrectly wired to the board.

Regarding the audio drivers, Acer doesn't provide a standard executable package - you download a zip file and are presented with a folder of random file types, none of them being an .exe. I tried running the .cmd files in the packages, but they didn't appear to do anything. When I ran them as admin, they all failed, so I don't even know if they were the correct driver files to begin with (Acer's support site said they were.)

Could I try a USB headset? I suppose I could, but I'd have to buy one (I tried three weeks ago, but the package was apparently lost somewhere between Amazon and USPS) but, to be completely honest, after spending a GRAND on a laptop, EVERYTHING should work out of the box, without issue. I work in IT, so I understand that PCs can be quirky and you occasionally get a lemon. However, for the volume of complaints about Acer audio jacks, this appears to be something Acer is turning a blind eye to, which is a shame, considering the price of this laptop.",1,4,CPU: Intel Core i7 9th GenCapacity: 17.3-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook only,Verified Purchase,"December 6, 2020",United States
B08777BH1B,R3H3KJ9P0XZD05,Sarah A.,"Absolutely worth the price, despite a few shortfalls","This laptop has been absolutely incredible. It runs games well, it's incredibly fast, and I love how lightweight it is. Despite its relatively long list of annoyances, I still find it worth the money.

CONS:
- Bottom can get quite warm (you will experience this with most med-range gaming laptops, I bought a laptop cooling fan to help, and it's been a perfect solution)
- Some keys stick. This is particularly annoying as I'm a student typing out notes continually through word processors. It has trouble with a lot of keys for me, such as ""T"", ""R"", “D”, “V”, and ""C"". I have to go back and fix the spelling errors or make sure to hit the keys really hard, which is a headache.
- Fingerprints/grease show up quite easily. Make sure to clean the laptop well.
- It has occasionally defaulted to the Intel GPU rather than the NVIDIA, which is quite annoying. This can be fixed by going into the NVIDIA settings/control panel.
- Sound quality is sub-par, as it sits on the bottom of the laptop.
- Low storage (I had to purchase a 1 TB SSD drive - 2.5"" SATA)

PROS:
-Stunning graphics
- Upgradeable slots
- Extremely high speed (loads up within 3-4 seconds)
- VR capable (I use the Oculus Quest 2 with a cable)

With the Nvidia graphics card I thought that didn't make much sense so after looking into it I figured out that the graphics card isn't even enabled by default when you first set the computer up.

I clock my CPU down to 80% in power management, and run my fans at max while gaming. Have had no performance issues since then. CPU temp will sit around 80 and spike up briefly to mid-90's while gaming.

Graphics card is cool as a cucumber. Will sit around 70 degrees while under 100% load while gaming, never gets much higher than that.

Acer Nitro Sense is fantastic, I use it to set my fan speed to max before I enter a game. You will get the best performance this way. ALSO, MINIMIZE NItrosense after setting the fan speed. It uses about 10% CPU power animating the fans if you do not minimize it lol.

Also comes with cable to install in a large SSD drive. All round would definitely buy again!",5,3,CPU: Intel Core i7 9th GenCapacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook only,Verified Purchase,"December 23, 2020",United States

The main need for this unit versus other options was all the cores on the CPU and solid video card. We are using this to record parts of the worship service and then grab old worship services when we had the congregation attending in person. We end up splicing together old hymns and parts of worship adding text overlays for hymns and prayers. Even with this beefy processor and SSD the rendering of the one hour video for Youtube takes about 20 minutes, without 12 cores going this takes over an hour. So worth the cost of a gaming machine that we are not using for gaming. Also the nice big 17 inch screen is nice. The only really disappointing pat is that the USB-C connector is not a thunderbolt port that can be used to charge and to connect to a dock and add additional displays like my Dell Precision or Macbook pro, but then again this is much less expensive than both of those.",4,3,CPU: Intel Core i7 9th GenCapacity: 17.3-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook only,Verified Purchase,"October 19, 2020",United States

B08777BH1B,R1U47ED0PMGX31,Quite Melo,Awesome RTX laptop.,"I was very impressed with the specs of this computer right away for it being just over 1k in price. The RTX 2060 is an excellent GPU paired with the 9th generation i7. I decided to purchase the laptop for how simple it is to upgrade. So far I added 500GB of extra storage with the 2.5in SSD expansion bay. If I want more there is still room with the availability of the spare M.2 bay.
Opening up the back of the device is fairly straightforward, use a plastic pry tool after you remove all the screws or you will damage the case. My specific unit came with two 8GB sticks of RAM. I was hoping for one 16GB stick with an open slot for later. No worries this can be adjusted later (if you ever need more then 16GB of RAM ;)
I do agree with other reviewers, that this laptop does get warm during use. But all computers get warm, so get yourself a laptop stand. Or use your new computer to look up a DIY video.

B08777BH1B,R2ZXRH1VKT4QAV,Marley,"Good visuals and performance for the price, terrible keyboard","It's been 4 months since purchasing and I feel that I can give an accurate review of this laptop.

I bought the Nitro 5 with the 9th gen i7 and RTX 2060 to upgrade my laptop I bought almost 10 years ago so I was long overdue for an upgrade. As far as gaming performance goes, I couldn't be happier. As long as I'm not playing a game with keyboard controls.

It's possible not every keyboard is like mine but the lower left part of the keyboard basically only registers inputs 50% of the time. The left control button in particular requires me to put really hard pressure on it for it to register. As a programmer, this is a pretty big downside as even trying to press CTRL-Z ends up in a ""z"" being inserted into the code editor rather than an undo.

Even if the keys were working the overall feel of the keys is pretty terrible and very squishy. The touchpad also, even on lowest sensitivity settings often will pick up your palm that's an inch away from it and cause mis inputs.

I'm past the 90 day coverage but luckily I have a mechanical keyboard I use instead. For a $1000+ laptop though, I'm pretty disappointed that it feels like they cheaped out on such a key feature.",3,3,CPU: Intel Core i7 9th GenCapacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook only,Verified Purchase,"November 18, 2020",United States
B08777BH1B,R3QO2YO2Y6P3QN,Kevin Thai Trinh,Awesome Gaming Laptop!!! Though it does have some issues.,"An amazing gaming machine. You can honestly play any AAA games at max settings 60+ fps. If you wanna have a consistent 144fps experience then I recommend playing at medium high settings (obviously depending on the game).

Pros:
- Excellent for everyday use
- Handles games at medium high, max settings really well
- 144hz is like eye candy
- Great machine overall

BUT that isn't to say that the laptop doesn't have issues of its own

Cons:
- Mediocre battery life, 3-4 hours during typical non-gaming use (always carry the power brick)
- Fans get really loud but that's because nitrosense, Acer's cooling software, automatically sets an rpm depending on the load and temps
- Temps are a tad bit high but it never throttled during my use
- Decent ssd but storage is really lacking (256gb ssd)
^ but there's another m.2 slot and a 2.5 hdd or sata ssd slot so upgrading shouldn't be an issue.

TL;DR
This laptop is a competent gaming rig, though it does have issues of its own. If you want a good gaming PC for 1000-1100 USD then look no further.",4,5,CPU: Intel Core i7 9th GenCapacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook only,Verified Purchase,"August 9, 2020",United States

High speeds, runs smooth, cool red keyboard light, nitrosense to see customize the fans, and 144 hz which made graphics and watching vids super smooth. Only issues I had was how bulky it was, not a fan of the power jack on the back, and the Ram and SSD space but obviously that could be upgraded yourself. Yes I knew you could purchase separate RAM and SSD upgraded parts but the bulkiness of the design was the reason I returned it. I ended up going with an Acer Aspire 5 thats pre-upgraded with 32 gb ram and 1 TB SSD that provides good space for gaming, video editing and stuff for work and on top, its low profile being thin and no crazy designs. I lose the 144 hz which I noticed but it isn't really a huge deal.

As I type this review I'll be going back to fix the times the space bar doesn't work as the right side of it doesn't register all the time. Also, as many others have mentioned, I had to knock down the max CPU usage to 99% to keep this rig from overheating. i7 potential and price with i5 performance. Great. Years of using poor/poorly applied thermal paste is keeping this from being a respectable contender in the budget gaming laptop arena. As soon as the warranty is up, or I need this as my main, I'll be cracking this thing open and reapplying a thermal paste the factory should have in the first place. Also, every time I disconnect my headphones I need to restart the laptop for it to recognize them next time I plug them in...and yes, my drivers are up to date.

B08777BH1B,R3HSFRTRYS2U4J,Jon,Buyer Beware: Screen or graphics = crap,"Got this brand new, out of box, hooked it up to a HD monitor. Right out the gate, the screen intermittently starts messing up. Lines across the screen, dots, a bunch of round circled dots, weird shape formations randomly on the screen, etc. It doen't happen 24/7, but it happens constant enough for it to be a big problem.

So I thought it was the monitor. Nope! Unplugged it and it was still doing crap on the laptop screen.

So far I've tried:

- Updating the graphics driver to the latest
- Adjusting every GHZ under display settings
- Various HDMI cables to the monitor

Nothing has fixed this and it's been over a month. Only reason I still have it is because I need it for work and I can't be without a computer while it's in the repair shop or being returned.

For this to happen to a BRAND NEW computer is bs.

Acer's support wanted me to ship the laptop back to them for warranty repair, which they said would take up to 40 days! My son needs this for school (and gaming, of course). I returned it to Amazon and got a replacement in two days - Amazon was very good about this. The replacement is going strong a few months later. Acer support was difficult to work with, spoke broken English, and wanted me to be out of a laptop I just purchased, for a month and a half, which is completely unacceptable.

As for performance, this laptop is great. Heat management is very bad however, and I would never actually use this in someones lap - we had to get a laptop stand under it to keep it cool enough, while sitting on a table.

B08777BH1B,RFPAUFUJZ2MV3,BOOZEY,"Keyboard poorly responsive/GPU and CPU performance are good, as expected","I purchased this laptop to be an upgrade from the previous machine I was using. I was encouraged to go forth with the purchase, as cyber Monday included a roughly $200 discount on the total price. Having used the machine now, I wouldn't exactly say I'd be too happy if I did not get it during the holidays, and with that discount. The GPU (RTX 2060) performs well, as expected. I always run system diagnostics as a first priority, when purchasing electronics online, to verify the components come as advertised. Battery life is medium-poor. But that is to be expected with this type of power-drawing performance, and in addition, can get very hot. The Nitro 5 comes with NitroSense pre-installed on the computer. This software lets you monitor the temperature of your CPU and GPU, realtime. As well, you can use it to adjust the speed settings of the internal cooling fans. The cooling fans seem to nearly run full blast (set to automatic) when playing any game. I have tried a few graphic intensive games, as well as Minecraft (which shouldn't be too terribly demanding) and it seems that no matter what, if you're playing a game; expect CPU average temperatures of 89 degrees Fahrenheit. This is, of course, to be expected of a gaming laptop. Of course you could turn down your graphic settings and possibly keep the machine much cooler that way, but that is not exactly something I'd like to do myself, considering the purchase was made specifically to be able to slam those graphic settings to the max whilst still maintaining playable framerates. My biggest bone to pick with this laptop is its keyboard. Its keyboard is quite honestly, very very disappointing. Yes, it has its RED backlighting and nicely sized keycaps to the tune of a full keyboard with numpad; But the keys are very irresponsive. You almost have to mash the keys to have it register a keystroke. As well, you cant just mash the keys, you have to do it almost in the center of the keycap itself. In addition to that, my (A) keycap came from the box a little bit oversized, and I mean by millimeters. But this causes it to catch on the web-bezel in between itself and the (Q) key, and makes a very audible click, as well as make it even harder to register a keystroke. My solution to the bum (A) key and overall poor responsiveness of all the keys was to purchase a keyboard cover for $6. I got the clear one so I could still have that wicked red glow from the backlight. This seemed to help dramatically. It kept the oversized (or slightly poor positioned) ((A)) key from catching on the bridge between by molding its position. In regards to the poor responsiveness, the keyboard cover provides slightly more resistance to the keys, forcing me to press the keys harder anyway, which seems to result in a registered keystroke. With the keyboard cover, I'm finding myself typing more naturally and making less mistakes than I did without it, it seems to make it possible to not have to press the center of the key as well, as the cover will pushing down on the entirety of each individual keycap by dividing the pressure throughout it. Long story short, buy a keyboard cover with this. It might even save you from crumbs and liquids spills.

Cons is definitely battery life when gaming you maybe have half an hour unplugged at full charge. When off charge I do notice that there's alot of freezing, freezing stops with plugged back on charge. Maybe it's a setting I'm missing but I'm not sure. This laptop gets extremely hot when gaming and I would definitely recommend an external fan to help cooling.

B08777BH1B,R368112T2N790Z,Definitely Trust this Review,Awesome computer for gaming but it comes with a cost: relatively short battery life.,"I just recently purchased the Acer Nitro 5 Core-i7 with 15.6 display screen as well as the mouse. The computer is awesome for gaming because you get really good frame rates in games like Minecraft, as well as Fortnite. However, it does seem to be inconsistent at some points because it can have really good frame rates at some point but really poor framerates at other times. I don't really know the reasoning behind this, these are just my observations. My gameplay in Minecraft (in the max settings), I got around 120-200 FPS and in Fortnite (in the max settings), I got around 100-160 FPS. When I ran Fortnite, after a few minutes of playing, the fan started to get noticeably louder and louder which I don't mind but just another observation. It does get quite loud but I just increase the volume so the noise is pretty much cancelled out. I really enjoy gaming with this computer but the battery life only goes for at least two hours until you have to charge it while playing. Another thing I've noticed with this computer is that the some of the keys in the keyboard seems somewhat tough to press on. If you do decide to get this gaming laptop, expect to apply more force than usual onto the keyboard because some of the keys can be stuck. Other than these two things (battery life and keyboard), this is an excellent gaming computer, would definitely invest into something like this again. Don't forget, if you buy this gaming laptop with the mouse, the mouse is WIRED (by USB), not Bluetooth, so be aware of that.",5,Helpful,CPU: Intel Core i7 9th GenCapacity: 15.6-inch 144HzStyle: Notebook only,Verified Purchase,"November 24, 2020",United States

I'm glad my previous laptop didn't suffer the issue. While I have an external gaming mouse connected, there are those rare moments the Touch Pad is helpful to have but I can work around this shortcoming. Added an additional 1 TB SSD and really have no complaints aside the issue I mentioned with the performance. The fans can be a bit noisy if you're pushing the system but overall Auto setting does a decent job of keeping things cool and quiet.

So far the overall experience has been basically flawless. Gaming-wise; Hunt: Showdown runs on high settings around 100-120 FPS consistently (and that game is slightly unoptimized), CS:GO maxed out completely.

Only little gripe I have is the backspace key is a tad sticky. If I don't press it in the dead-center, it requires a more effort to get it to function. I doubt it was during shipping since everything else is pristine, probably just a mistake during manufacturing. I might be able to take it off and fix it, but it's really not that big of a deal.

Not much heat is felt on the bottom of the laptop; however the section between the monitor hinges and keyboard may burn your hands as most of the heat is felt from there. An additional laptop cooler and probably new thermal pasting (not done on mines) will be needed.
Some flexibility with the fan speeds can be done, but undervolting may not be possible without adjusting its settings.

B07YNHXX8D,R1FXM2CFUFCG1,Honest Reviewer,"The Pros, Cons and Oks for the Surface Pro 7 (HR).","Pros:
• USB-C, Finally! As a past Surface Pro user, this was never a feature. With a USB-C, like any computer, you can do so much more with this device now. From headphones to connecting external 4k monitors, to charging this and other devices (USB-C chargers are 10x cheaper to get), to even connecting an Ethernet adaptor. About time Microsoft.
• It’s a very sold machine. I go no flex issues, the frame feels sturdy, and overall I felt that I can throw this in a bag and not worry.
• It’s light. Not IPad light, but enough that you won’t feel worried that you’re not going to bend it.
• The microphone set up on the Pro is a big upgrade. Skype calls from my parents came crisp and clear in an indoor, TV on, volume. The web video is what it is, but the microphone setup is a thumbs up.
• Cortana listens to you pretty well. I’m learning Spanish so translating even simple questions, from English to Spanish, Cortana does a lot better than either using Alexa or Google Assistant. Also questions about directions, weather, and others were spot on.
• Excellent display. The screen is bright, outstanding saturation/color balance, and also offers ambient light sensing when it gets dark. When you go to settings you can modify it for a specific time, or it will automatically adjust when the sun goes down in your location.
• Microsoft mastered the kickstand on this. Numerous ranges of all angels, and is even quite steady when it’s placed on my lap.
• microSD reader (for upgraded memory option)
• Headphone Jack. I find this feature a must if you’re planning to edit videos on this.
• Solid State Drive (SDD) on a tablet size is one of the best things. If you have to choose, always an SSD, regardless of memory size. Faster, cooler, and
• Charging on this is very fast. From 0 to 50% it took around 45-50 minutes. Note that I was using the charging cords that it came with. Don’t expect the same results when using an off-brand.
• A lot of horsepower for a tablet. Inside is an Ice Lake processor. To summarize, it features smaller transistors that makes multi-tasking an non-issue. Trying out for the first time with around 10 apps running (Madden, Netflix, Live Maps, Grand Trims Mo, etc.), the machine had no lag or hiccups. Largely the effects of this chip will be appreciated in the next 2 years from when you get this tablet.
• The processor allows Wi-Fi 6 to be enforced on this tablet. This area is still new but within the next year, this tablet will already be up to date with the hardware. Meaning stronger upload and download rates.
• The speakers shoot sound directly to my face. Turning on Spotify, I got a decent quality in sound. With rock and country, I got a very balanced, and a lot of power in the volume. For the average listener it’s quite good. Not IPad level but still good to make the list.
• I can see the 3:2 screen a benefit for those who want to read, show notes, and display documents at work. Not many tablets can provide this without losing some quality. For me, I saw no waste in this Surface.

Cons and Oks:
• The chunky bezel. Stick to the times Microsoft, this can’t be ignored in 2019. It’s very thick and with competitors providing bezel-less frames, or close to it, this is a major turn off (Not to mention that Microsoft itself has a Surface Pro X with a design that is significantly less in the bezel. (Why not this one?).
• With the bezel issue, the screen size makes the tablet look 2 years older than what it is.
• Last year's model and this one are 99% the same in design. Remove the USB-C connector and it’ll be 100% the same. A very outdated design as I think Microsoft invested all their money on the internals and just forgot about the redesigning.
• The battery life isn’t great. I’m getting around 8 hours of power. That’s having Wi-Fi always on, web surfing, daily YouTube playing, and a couple of hours with Netflix (plus a couple of smaller apps). It can last a whole day if you control your power and your screen display, but it’s nowhere near what Microsoft is saying.
• Don’t take it outside on a sunny day. That sun glare is too powerful for this display brightness.
• Keyboard and Surface Pen are sold separately. I didn’t test these as you only get the tablet.
• Even though USB-C is a great thing to have, we’re already in the USB 3.1 world. With also no Thunderbolt 3 (quick file transfer) I wish that Microsoft put more effort into the outside design as much as they put in there hardware on this machine.
• I found no issue playing Overwatch on this but trying to play Call of Duty forget it. This isn’t for deep gaming and playing Overwatch killed a decent chunk of the battery.

Bottom Line:

If you’re going to buy this, you need to at least invest in there keyboard cover. It’s disappointing that to fully experience your Pro, you need to put down money on its keyboard and pen. Without a keyboard, from my experience, you’re pretty limited. I used a Logitech Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, but the portably is limited if you can’t attach them to the Surface Pro.

Also we're in the age of laptops, tablets, and phones trying to reach the goal to be bezel-less. I have the previous model on hand and I can’t tell them apart in any way. Thanks to these 2019 new laptops/tablets, the bezels on this device make it feel like this tablet is from 2017. I’m also irritated that Microsoft didn’t at least try to improve the design.

But if you can deal with the design (and the battery) issues, you’ll know that Microsoft put all their money on what’s inside the system. From the new core processors, this tablet is a beast. I found it very fast, reliable, and it will stand its ground for 2+ years. For me that’s the beauty of a Surface Pro: a PC in the size of a tablet. I’m always a PC fan and this performs as if I had a laptop on my lap, something an IPad can’t do. If you can deal with the generic bezel look, and put money down for their keyboard, you’re getting a beast of a computer fitting in a tablet.

Overall: An outdated design that packs a lot of power for those who want more than just a generic tablet on the go.

Hope I was a help to you.

B07YNHXX8D,RFOYWP27OKQEY,DJ,XPS 13 vs Yoga C940 vs Surface Pro 7 2-in-1's,"Comparing Dell XPS 13, Lenovo Yoga C940 14 and Surface Pro 7 2-in-1's all with i7-1065G7 CPU/GPU.

[SP7 PROS:]
-Best 3:2 aspect ratio is better for productivity (but screen is uncomfortably small) > XPS 16:10 > Yoga 16:9
-IR camera for Windows Hello face sign-in, though not useful when docked or when screen is not at the correct angle
-Least weight 2.4 lbs > 3 lbs for others
-Quietest fan > Yoga > XPS (loudest)
[SP7 CONS:]
-Worst battery life (even worse than SP6)
-Smallest 12.3"" display with thick bezels
-No 4K UHD option (but I recommend FHD with any brand/model for battery life, you can always dock to a larger monitor)
-No Thunderbolt 3 with PD/DP (no eGPU)
-Keyboard and pen sold separately

[XPS PROS:]
-Up to 32GB RAM > 16GB on others
-Slimmest
-Fingerprint reader on power button > Yoga on palmrest > SP7 on non-included $160 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID
[XPS CONS:]
-No USB-A (deal breaker for me)
-No black exterior option. The white interior option keyboard is hard to see with the white backlighting
-No far field microphones for Alexa or other assistants
-Included charger is only 45W (less than 65W with Yoga/SP7)

[YOGA PROS:]
-Best screen-to-body ratio (89%) > XPS 84.9% > SP7 76.76%; although the hinge factors into this
-Largest screen 14"" > XPS 13.4"" > SP7 12.3""
-Deepest key travel, most comfortable keyboard > XPS > SP7
-Better Arrow Keys + Home/End/Pg Up/Pg Down layout
-INCLUDED garaged pen with internal charging > magnetically attached and not included with purchase on others
-Best in class speakers. Rotating soundbar with Dolby Atmos sounds amazing! Gets loud!
-Built-in camera shutter
-Coolest under heavy load > SP7 gets warm > XPS hottest
-Fastest Rapid charge (2 hours in 15 minutes)
-Largest 65 WHr battery > XPS 51 WHr > SP7 45 WHr
[YOGA CONS:]
-Shortest 16:9 aspect ratio with large ""chin"" bezel at bottom of screen face
-No MicroSD slot compared to others
-Anti-glare customizable option no longer available

[CONS OF ALL:]
-No HDMI
-No dedicated GPU option, though Thunderbolt 3 on XPS and Yoga allows external GPUs for gaming. Not available on SP7. eGPU great for gaming, allows modular upgradability of graphics cards in the future, although they lose ~20% FPS compared to PCIe.

[PRICING:]
For i7, 16GB, 512GB with Windows 10 Home:
YOGA 4K $1785 > XPS 4K + pen $1900 > SP7 FHD + type cover + pen $2160

[CONCLUSION:]
The SP7 was the most expensive when you add the keyboard and pen. The XPS FHD with 32GB RAM came in at $1730. I would like to see a 32GB 4K 512GB option since I don't need that much on-device storage.

All have performance improvements over their predecessors thanks to the new 10th gen Intel i7 processors, LPDDR4x RAM and WiFi 6. The Surface Book 2 is too dated to compare here and is clunkier.

It's a toss up between the XPS for its 32GB RAM with taller screen, or the Yoga with its USB-A port, better keyboard, and garaged pen, among other things. The extra RAM comes in useful since the integrated graphics will use some of that. The 16GB models easily ran up to 80% CPU, RAM and GPU when driving 2 external monitors and simultaneously running Chrome with tabs, Office apps, iTunes and light gaming. It often sits at 8GB RAM under normal use.

Some may appreciate all the ports being on one side as with the Yoga, or having ports on either side as with the XPS. The dedicated volume rockers on the SP7 comes in handy. The lighter weight of the SP7 made it the first to be grabbed on the go for content consumption or note taking, but I prefer the Yoga for content creation with it's larger screen and comfy keyboard. If you're docking all day and only occasionally need to be on the go then I recommend the XPS for its 32GB RAM.

B07YNHXX8D,R3MEPJXBF5BN5B,Michael,The Surface Pro 7 is a worthy and underrated follow-up to the Pro 6,"I'm seeing complaints about how this isn't a major redesign of the Pro 6. That may be true, but the internals are where it's at. I mean, I love this thing. It's like having a decently powerful desktop PC in the form factor of a tablet, which can quickly become a laptop. For instance, I installed an Xbox Game Pass game (Ori and the Blind Forest) and it ran amazingly smooth; I had no idea a 12 inch tablet could run a game with Xbox One-quality graphics even in 2019. Sure, it's not gonna run Gears 5 in 4K, but how many tablets can say they can run even a game like Ori at decent settings?

People keep saying ""it's just like the Pro 6 but with a USB-C connector!"" But it's been confirmed by multiple sources that the Pro 7's i5 processor is better than the Pro 6's i7 processor. And yeah, having a USB-C connector is pretty nice.

Yes, the bezels are slightly thicker than most 2019 phones and tablets, but it's a non-issue for me. I use the Surface in tablet mode and it would be incredibly annoying to accidentally touch things on the screen because there's nowhere to put my hands for the sake of A E S T H E T I C S. It's a silly complaint, in my opinion.

I'm a grad student, so I need to be able to plop down anywhere -- the library, a cafe, my mom's house, a friend's house, wherever -- and get work done in a way that my phone simply isn't right for. But I also want to be able to stream movies, edit videos, play videogames, and so on. So far, the Surface Pro 7 has done everything I want and more.

Literally the only bummer is that Microsoft STILL isn't bundling the type cover in with the tablet. Springing an extra $150 for something that feels like an essential part of the package is a huge bummer. I wish they could figure out a way to include the type cover, even if they have to make some compromises.",5,254,"Color: PlatinumCapacity: 8 GB Ram, 128GBConfiguration: Intel Core i5",Unverified Purchase,"October 31, 2019",United States

B07YNHXX8D,R2BA2I662RFPP4,Anthony,Don’t buy the surface pro 7 from amazon,"Well where do i start..... i ended up getting my item and everything was good for about 20mins of use... however after 20mins my screen would freeze for 10-30 secs. I blew it off at first but then it happen 10mins after then it became a often issue. So i ended up going for an exchange. (The worst idea I’ve ever had). I called up amazon and told them my issue and they were quick to get me a replacement so as first i was satisfied until the surface pro 7 came in the next day. I open the box to find out the box it comes in is not only damage but in a renewed box didn’t even come in the same box it should have come in, then i open that to see the surface pro and the screen film wrapped around it was really dirty as if they dropped it in dirt or so and fingerprints all over the machine. So at this point I’m just hoping it works. This one was not charged at all at 15% like it usually is if you were to buy from Microsoft or an apple device would normally be. So i put it on the charger to find out that it not only has screen tear straight down the middle of the screen but a big red dot half the size of the screen was on there as if they drop the surface pro. So at this point i immediately call amazon and i talked to a representative that ended up giving me a hard time about another replacement even though this one was obviously there fault. So i ended up talking to a supervisor that ended up giving me a hard time as well and in the she said to me that they only do a exchange once but as a one time exception they’ll do the exchange to which i responded with i only want to do the exchange if it’s a brand new product that they are giving me not a renewed one and undamaged. To which she agreed that she would make sure it would be done and put in her notes so the wear house knows. Well the next day came and guess what.... the man that drops it off throws my package at the wall of my house from a big distance he didn’t see me at all so when i raced over the man jumped in his car and quickly drove away knowing what he did. Not only this but when i open the box the surface pro again was in a dirty renewed box, at this point I’m just hoping it still even worked again no power so i plug it in and guess what it works surprisingly after all that. However i Notice something was different with the boot up process so i knew something was wrong i go to the setting of the computer and the version i bought was 8gb of ram i5 model with 128gb of memory the one i receive as a replacement this time was a 4gb version i5 model with 128gb of memory and GUESS WHAT A DIFFERENT GRAPHICS CARD AS WELL. The surface pro 7 i got not only had 4gb of ram which was wrong but a different graphics card as well that comes in a surface pro 5 are you serious.... so i called up customer service again asking for a supervisor yet again..... just wanting a refund the man told me well i see here that you have a couple of exchange for this device already so i told him this story i am telling now and ask him i wonder why i have “a couple of exchanges” to which he said well instead of a refund i can get you a brand new one and told me how he had to make a couple of phone calls to do this for me so i told him this is the last exchange I’ll be getting ill be asking for a refund next like i previously wanted..if the next one comes in the renewed box which that would mean it’s used.. if it’s broken or the wrong model I’m done with trying and I’m done with the surface pro 7. not only was this the worst experience with amazon that I’ve ever had and worst costumer Service but now I’m going to hate the surface pro 7 because of this. I’ll see what i receive next as of 02/23/2020

B07YNHXX8D,R2DJ64OX3J9OXX,Alfredo,i5 10th gen /8gb RAM / 128GB,"I initially bought a Surface Go(8gb) for a gift and when I had it in my hands I fell in love with the Surface. I had to get one for myself. Since I didn't find another 8gb surface go model, I went w/ the Pro 7 i5/8gb model myself. I am in love with this device. Watching netflix is great, Illustrator and other drawing software works great w/ the surface pen. Keyboard took a few minutes to get the hang of it and I quite enjoy it, it works well. It is a bit heavy when holding it w/ one hand (this is why I loved the Surface GO version for normal tablet use) but it is quite light overall.

Also tested a few games and it actually surprised me a bit tacking into account this is the i5 model. I am able to play Halo Reach just fine, (note that I had to lower the resolution down to 1080p) and it plays good. Minecraft plays really well. I didnt actually get this for gaming ( lol ) but it plays light games just great (of course it gets warm w/ Reach). StardewValley FTW!

Currently this is my primary device and it performs extremely well. If you have the extra cash, do go for the i7 model mainly for the 16gb of RAM. OS consumes around 2.5-3GB of ram, so that doesnt leave much left on the 8GB model.

I was looking for something that had the horsepower for what I needed, but also the lightness to carry it around. Although battery life isnt, the best, I DON'T MIND!

This thing is a beast! Im very happy running programs like tableau, zoom, excel, powerpoint, all at the same time and with various files and this thing doesn't even flinch. The first few hours setting up and downloading all the programs it felt a big sluggish and I was starting to get worried. Once that was done, it started to fly.

Yes, the rotating screen isnt as flawless as apple's iPad. That said, I bought this not to look pretty, i bought it to be my tool in battle. Being able to run all the programs that a regular PC can run is the main decision I went for Microsoft Surface. The only downside is that Microsoft is a bit costly on the accessories front.

I recommend this piece of tech to anyone who needs to travel or is on the move. I'm a relatively big guy and i've had no major problem with the size of the keyboard. I do put it FLAT on tables because my keystrokes tend to be pretty hard and the keyboard is the most (in my opinion) fragile of the accessories.

B07YNHXX8D,R1O3V8ZQA6PZTA,Jennifer,LOVE this device,"The portability and comfort of the tablet with the functionality of a full-fledged laptop. I bought a Surface 3 several years ago and now... I can't go back. I love these things too much. It comes with me everywhere. If you're wondering why buy a Surface which is twice the price of a laptop, here's why:
1. If you read a lot of pdfs or e-books there is no comparison.
Using the pen on pdfs, the ability to jot down notes in word or pictorial form, the ability to create links to other information that can later be clicked on: Unmatched anywhere else
Turn it sideways and it's a full sheet of paper for writing and notetaking
Turn it sideways to read Comic Books! OMG!
I'll be honest, I'm a gamer and this is my gaming buddy. I pull up ESO maps and One Note allows me to mark up the maps I find online to check off what I've accomplished, rearranged, plan, it's incredible
2. Versatility
I watch a lot of movies and tv on my advice. It's comfortable, easy to hold, just the right size screen, phenomenal graphics and good sound
As previously stated, I read on my device
I am a student. I Word Process. A LOT
I am an Excel nut. I spreadsheet like a crazy person. I attach a mouse and organize my life.
I spend a ton of time using video conferencing on this thing
3. Physical Perfection (OK so it is not as light as your tablet but for what it can do, totally worth the extra weight which isn't that much)
Just the right size screen which is totally touch and pen friendly
Good battery life and easy and fast to charge. Not so happy about the way the charger connects with the longer part of the charger pointing down which makes it super easy to accidentally dislodge the magnet (CON 1)

In my opinion, this is the perfect electronic for my lifestyle

So, what's wrong with it?
Only one USB port and no place to insert extra storage or portable storage without using your only USB port
No MICRO SD Card slot
The Charger connection is A. Not universal and B. Stupidly located. You'd think Microsoft would have figured out by now that if you use a laptop ON your lap it'll get disconnected due to poor location
BUY THE KEYBOARD! If you want a tablet, buy a tablet, If you want a computer you need a keyboard why doesn't it just come with one?

Bottom line is this. If you need something versatile and not specialized, this is your computer. It's worth the money. If you're looking for something to run a specialized program or a gaming computer, this is probably not your computer. It's not the most powerful device on the market but it is by FAR the most versatile. I could not recommend a better device for students. Buy a protective case, throw it in your backpack, purse, tote, car, suitcase, whatever let it become a part of you, you won't regret it.

The Surface Pen is great and the magnet makes for a very secure attachment. I considered the Surface Pro X, because it has an option for stowing the slim pen in its keyboard but opted for the regular surface pen after trying them out in a retail store.

I've deducted one star because:

The large bezel. Doesn't bother me much at all, but it really doesn't stack up to competitor designs in 2019/2020. Still looks very sleek overall.

Windows 10 works surprisingly well in tablet mode, but Microsoft is really missing an opportunity by not having a good built-in or Office e-reader (epub, pdf, mobi support) with pen support for document/ebook markup. Edge doesn't cut it feature-wise. Luckily there's a popular app in the Microsoft Store called Drawboard PDF that works really well. The lack of Microsoft application support for critical Surface features is another reason for deducting a star! OneNote and other apps were great on here.

1. It started with the internet connection. All of the sudden it would not connect and would only go back online after I would reset my router for some odd reason.
2. The battery has been really bad, I’ve had to plug it after 4-5 hrs of use.
3. I’ve had multiple blue error screens appear randomly
4. The software updates are said to be completed and asks to restart the surface but even after I restarted it (multiple times) it still shows that the update is not completed. This issue does not let me download other programs or apps.
5. I’ve called Microsoft way more times over the past month. After at least 5 calls in which they tried resetting to factory settings, downloading the updates, etc... They sent me a replacement that was even worse...so slow to get to any website, it would take 1-2 minutes to open google. I’ve sent the replacement back and they are supposed to send me a new one but honestly I would rather get my money back and buy a different one.

B07YNHXX8D,RSJPINPVA2PSK,Dr. Drake Duntov,The worst of 2 worlds,"To start off with, I did NOT receive a damaged or older device as some others have. I received exactly what I paid for. As such, my complaints are with the actual device design and performance.

This is supposed to be a 2 in 1, right? Magazine and internet articles keep talking this thing up with ridiculous statements eluding to Microsoft having perfected the design. The ""Best of both worlds!"" they proclaim. No way. It's not going to be a good device, to begin with since it runs Windows 10, which is horrible. It's basically an inferior version of Win7 with an Xbox-like interface. Underneath, it's still an M$ mess. There's really no reason for it other than to run newer games, which I wouldn't recommend this thing. It's too slow and cumbersome. But I didn't buy it for gaming. I have a hot-rod custom rig for that. I bought for both basic and professional visual design work. For the basics, my smartphone does a better job. For the visual work, I have a large collection of software I bought and paid for. I've given up trying. This thing is slow, the screen (even with a decent ppi) has low brightness, terrible contrast, and a limited color gamut. The touchscreen has a poor response to both finger and pen. The i7 doesn't perform well, heats up, and has an annoying fan. The digital storage, tiny capacity, and all, doesn't feel much quicker than an old mechanical drive. The battery life is pathetic, even with all the settings turned down to a crawl; when it's slow on maximum. So, as a laptop replacement, I cannot take it seriously.

As a tablet, it's probably the worst in history. I already mentioned how terrible the screen response is, but if Win10 desktop is bad, the tablet version is downright horrible. I'd rather use a regular pencil and paper. Comparing to an iPad, in both device and software, wouldn't even be funny. But, a first-generation Android-powered tablet runs circles around it too.

Pros:
This computer is the perfect size for someone on the go. Its compact, but still has a decently sized screen for getting work done. In general, the computer is fast, the face recognition login is great when it works.
Cons:
There are many issues with the software or hardware, but I don't know which since I'm not a computer expert. The volume controls constantly freeze, so the volume is unable to be adjusted by any means until the computer gets restarted. There is an issue where the curser constantly freezes, but I can not tell if its the computer freezing or the mouse controls. As mentioned above, the face recognition login is fast, when it works. There have been many occasions where the face login stopped working randomly until the computer is restarted.

I don't know where these issues are coming from, but they can make this computer a pain in the butt to use.

Although it still lacks many of the apps that android and apple have, now the sp7 battery life lasts much more and has much less overheating, hence less noise from the cpu which is a huge plus.

Small cosmetic imperfection on bottom or back of item. Missing bonus material. Missing manual. Accessories may have cosmetic damage. Item will come in original packaging.

I'm not fine with a unit that has clearly been dropped with the entire lower, left corner bent/crushed and the ""cosmetic"" damage to the lower left screen is actually the display inside (the cover/coating is fine) has been bent/pinched.

It won't even fit in a form fitting Otterbox case the bend is pronounced enough.

When I wrote the review below, I did not know WHY it had a minidisplay port. It ALSO has a dual core NOT a quad core like the surface pro 7. This is not an honest mistake. I paid for ""the latest model"".

Original issue here:
I am 65, have been disabled for 8 years, and am learning a new career out of necessity. The career requires a tablet, so after exhaustive research, I invested in a loaded Microsoft Surface Pro 7. This is a huge deal for me. As I am waiting on the keyboard and other accessories, I am learning how to use it - my first tablet. The 5-in-1 hub adapter I purchased did not fit. How could this be? I bought one for Type C port, newly available on the new version of this tablet. The Amazon ad said newest version. Ends up the tablet has what I believe is a mini-display port in place of a Type C, so I can't use it. I have to return the tablet. I NEED THIS FOR WORK. I WASTED MONEY ON THE HUB ADAPTER. I WASTED TIME LOADING THIS COMPUTER THAT I NEEDED TO USE IN TRAINING. Very unhappy.

If someone compensates me and makes this right I will remove this comment. But I am leaving it now because I just got a response from Amazon

The screen size is just right for me as I don’t like large computers. I have also purchased a wireless keyboard and mouse for when at home to make it even easier to use when typing papers or working on projects. I also purchased a cute flowered skin with white. sage, pink and gray to protect the metal from any nicks or scratches. I also purchased the silver pen and got a sage green skin to protect it. I like that the pen magnetically attaches to the side of the Surface Pro 7 and that the pen can erase using the eraser on the pen. The only reason I gave it four rather than five stars is that I am finding that not all apps are offered in the Surface Pro that I currently have. The selection seems quite limited and you can’t get apps from iTunes or Google Play as neither service is compatible with Windows. I am most disappointed that Scribd is not offered as I was hoping to be able to read books while in flight. I have read that there is VM Ware apps that may work. I am not very technical so I don’t know much about it. I appreciate any suggestions from Microsoft or techies on how I can upload Scribd on my Surface Pro 7.

B07YNHXX8D,R2SE4ZWAXER0I7,Tom Johnston,Great school tablet,"I really like this Surface Pro 7. It is exactly as advertised with one exception. The battery life is nowhere near what is advertised. On battery saving mode, using only Onenote for taking class notes, it lasts about 4 hours. Fortunately it charges up very quickly though. I can't see any way that I would get a full days use out of a full battery charge in any circumstance. In my case that is not very important because I am always around an outlet but if you need a tablet that will last all day away from a power source you will have a problem. The camera is good enough, not as good as the Apple camera, but I don't really use it as a camera anyway. I use mostly the 365 programs and find that it integrates these programs seamlessly. Onenote comes with the tablet and has been an amazing app for my vet school classes. It saves my many hours of study time. My only issues are with the instability of Onenote. It closes itself down every few minutes and is very frustrating. I'm sure there is a fix for this but I'm also sure that I won't get it from Microsorft as they have a technical support team that is on par with the customer service team at the cable company. I've contacted them 3 times now and my issue is never addressed. I was actually told to contact Amazon since they sold it to me. It seems like after spending a thousand dollars on Microsoft products they would at least provide a bit of tech support. I'll just have to scour the web for a fix to this I guess. Overall I would recommend this tablet to every student.

B07YNHXX8D,R27Q1JP0O22FGI,Dale A Eltoft,Great tablet but not a replacement for a real PC. Ships without a keyboard which is really needed.,Very portable fast and handy. The touch screen works ok but when using software designed for a full size screen with mouse and keyboard it can be awkward. Touching with a finger is not as accurate as a mouse and enlarging the image creates a tunnel vision situation when the whole webpage isn't visible. So bottom line a great tablet but not a replacement for a full size PC. Buying the keyboard helps a lot. With it typing is possible without giving up half the screen for a virtual keypad and there's a mouse touch pad eliminating the need to the touch screen when accuracy is needed. The connection of the charging cable and keyboard is a clever magnetic grab the eliminates the awkward insertion effort like for micro USB or headphones.,5,One,"Color: Matte BlackCapacity: 16 GB Ram, 512 GBConfiguration: Intel Core i7",Verified Purchase,"June 26, 2020",United States

So less compromises on the applications you may need to run. Latest i7 plus a decently fast SSD makes this a good portable workhorse.

The packaging & shipping is well done. The device shipped within the expected time frame.

As for the device itself, I found the screen size of 12.3 inches to be a little bit on the bigger side for a tablet mode but is perfect for laptop use. the screen colors are vibrant and supports touch. Windows Hello lets you sign into your account via face recognition, I find it to be more convenient than writing the password to login. I got the I5 8GB version and the windows 10 experience is very smooth for browsing the web, using Microsoft office and other productivity work. I believe for the average person there is no need to buy a higher specs, I5 can get the job done.

Surface pro 7 experience is not complete without the Type cover keyboard and Surface pen. Both are a must if you want get the best out of the device and they are worth their price tags.

I want to highlight that though this device is a 2-In-1, it is a significantly better laptop than a tablet.

I bought this laptop as new so I don't know the case for the rest of these reviews but mine came in the box sealed with plastic NEW WITH EVERYTHING WORKING. Screen works perfect as a laptop/tablet and connects well with my hotspot. The only downside is that I paid so much hoping for the sim card or esim option to be there but it wasn't and although the battery still needs improvement I find that if you allow the laptop to rest every hour the battery drains less. I work so I don't have to use it every second but something to keep in mind.

Update: Turns out this laptop has a tendancy to freeze a lot, so if your wifi is top tier you should have no worries. When I use public wifi (which I hate doing), im able to load pages etc. When i use my hotspot (not on my phone) it takes 5 minutes just to load a simple search. This wasn't the case when i first got it, and I even increased the gigs on my hotspot just for it to run.

There is no customer service from Microsoft. Amazon tech support is nice but they are not specialize on the products. Sadly I have to return it.

B07QQB7552,R6LCSTLRJAMSS,Dragon Eye,Macbook Vibes,"Honestly, the laptop is great! I did buy a 1x8GB kit of ddr4 sodimm 2400mhz cl16 ram to upgrade the memory on the laptop from the original 8GB, and I made a quick discovery that the laptop comes with 4GB of RAM soldered onto the motherboard, thus you can only replace the other stick of RAM in the populated RAM slot that has a 4GB stick in it. So I now have 12GB of RAM on my f512d ryzen model. Furthermore, the SSD that came included with my model used a Kingston 256GB SSD, leaving one open slot for a 2.5 inch Sata SSD or HDD. The battery life lasts about 2-3 hours on a near-full charge, and since my college classes require atleast a 1.5 hours of charge per class, I could dim down the display for less battery usage and possibly the keyboard backlights, but I'd say it's a win either way. Overall, the screen is IPS and beautiful, the entire system feels snappy and responsive, and I can actually run 3D applications on it without it bugging out like my last Samsung i3 laptop from 2013. Love AMD's new product lineup and I hope this helps anyone else looking to buy this laptop.

UPDATE:
Sadly, my unit didn't last long. I just began using my 3-d softwares and new code IDE's for C++ and this thing blue-screened every 5 minutes or so. Sometimes I was lucky and it'd work nicely but just today, the drive slowed down to a near halt and as windows tried to repair or reset it, it just died. I now boot into the bios everytime with no storage or boot-detection of the ssd. What a brilliant time for it to die. Also for battery life, turning off the keyboard backlighting litterally gave me 9+ hours of battery-life. Sad to see it go.

UPDATE #2:

B07QQB7552,R31RWYDN8C9U9F,Avidly-Aware,FALSE ADVERTISING (read if you’re curious),"This product seemed like a bargain...
(Ryzen 5 3500U, 8gb model)

SUMMARY (2400mhz RAM only runs @800mhz off the charger AT ALL TIMES) (ONLY 1 RAM SLOT)

DEEMED: DECEIVING

First things first...
THE RAM

Advertised at 2400mhz: with descriptions, reviews, and answers that are misleading. First thing to know: upon contacting ASUS, there are two possible motherboard configurations: one with 4gb of soldered RAM paired with a 4gb SODIMM, and a configuration with NO onboard RAM, and one 8gb SODIMM. I bought an extra RAM stick hoping to boost up to 12 GB only to find out I had the MB configuration NOBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT.
So you can imagine, as I’m about to add this sweet 8gb stick: there’s already just a single 8gb stick in the slot making the upgrade redundant.

Next, I decided to install CPU-Z to see what the hold-up was. I noticed the laptop was a bit slower than I expected for the specs when it wasn’t on the charger, and let’s be forward here the only reason anyone BUYS a laptop is to use in portable situations hence the expectation of full performance away from the plug. Anyway, upon installing CPU-Z I noticed a few things off about the RAM. First off, it ran at a native 1866mhz when plugged in UNTIL you do something that requires an extra push, at which time the RAM ramps up to the advertised 2400mhz. Secondly, I checked with the cord unplugged to find out the RAM was running at an APPALLING 800mhz. The ASUS spokesperson said that it was an expected feature and not a defect.
What makes things worse: I know how RAM modules work. A single SODIMM draws such a small amount of power, that revving it down to a speed equivalent to that of a mid-tier DDR2 module is unacceptable! Just another factory implementation of a throttling method to force people who get their PC for a bargain to regret making the right decision.

To make matters EVEN WORSE: this model comes equipped with a Ryzen 5 CPU. *What’s wrong with that?* What’s wrong with that is this: Ryzen CPU’s by design, are relatively dependent on the onboard RAM. MEANING: Slower RAM = Worse CPU performance.
So, RAM that performs at 1/3 of the advertised speed, (2400mhz is just OKAY for RAM in the first place) a single RAM slot with no option for dual channel, and a CPU that WILL perform slower as a result make this PC perform at the $150-$200 range when away from the charger.

B07QQB7552,R2KJE8QT2LKLCS,Carmel Bevensee,Honest Review From Perspective of a Coder/Production User,"When I was looking for a laptop I wasn't critical of reviews because I didn't think it mattered but when I saw the reviews for this laptop I got worried about my purchase. I'm going to set the record straight from what this product is actually like: good and bad.

This is an honest and critical review of the ASUS VivoBook 15 from the perspective of someone who uses this laptop for coding and production (NOTE: I have only used this laptop for a week).
________

CPU - Good. Very rarely will I notice quality/performance drops. It does its job.

GRAPHICS CARD - This is where I cannot help you with this specific system. I don't use it for its graphics capabilities. But you should know that if you're looking at this computer for gaming, don't buy it. Buy a system specifically designed for gaming. Even if it costs more.

STORAGE - For me, it's perfectly fine. But you should take five minutes and Google the size of gigabytes and the difference between hard drives and SSDs and all that to decide what you need. But if you don't work with entire databases, the default storage will do just fine.

BATTERY LIFE - Not good. Actually, pretty abysmal. If you run it on the highest of its four default battery life modes you are looking at.. one and a half hours maybe? But if you run it on the battery saver mode, you can easily get five hours. NOTE: The charger is very light and compact, so charging on the go is not hard.

SCREEN- Depends. If you have it on full brightness it is beautiful. Looks great. But on low brightness, it kind of looks bad. Not that bad though, so you should be fine.

AESTHETIC - A++. Looks amazing, is compact and the built-in stand doesn't take away anything from a normal laptop. I personally was worried that it wouldn't fit on my lap, but it is perfectly fine. The size isn't too big, not too small.
________

Overall, I absolutely love this thing. It's perfect for students who are on a budget but want something that operates and looks great. I saw something about ""MacBook vibes"" and I agree. If you have one thing to take away from this ACCURATE review, it's that this is the best laptop you can buy for $500.",4,75,Style: Ryzen 5 | 256GB SSD,Verified Purchase,"January 11, 2020",United States
B07QQB7552,R2C5LFLD1JH4G2,greg rougeau,Save Yourself; Don't Buy,"Nearly a week after I purchased the ASUS VivoBook 15, I posted a negative review. My gripes: terrible screen resolution, slow processing, poor sound, the sensitivity of the keyboard, and other issues. ASUS replied t the effect that they were ""gutted"" by negative reviews, and I took my post down (I hardly ever leave negative reviews, but I guess I should for the Amazon community). I learned how to deal with this clunky, poorlt manufactured machine. Today, on nearly the one-month anniversary of my purchase of this device, the screen turns off automatically when not connected to power, and I understand from online searches that this is a recurring problem with ASUS, for which ASUS apparently cannot provide customers assistance with. Time to get negative (again). Please save yourself the misery (and money) of purchasing this truly inferior product. I purchased it to replace an Apple MacBook, because I wanted Windows. I wish I never had. I'd like to turn this junk back in to see if I can get warranty on it, but I might be more satisfied throwing the device off a cliff.",1,52,Style: Ryzen 5 | 256GB SSD,Verified Purchase,"March 29, 2020",United States
B07QQB7552,R2DYJIA7LRP5Y8,Brandon Cassata,Fantastic price to performance ratio if you're not into gaming.,"I originally bought this computer with the intentions of programming on the go.

Let's get the bad out of the way first. This laptop is not designed, nor advertised for gaming by any stretch. You'll be able to get away with some older games but forget about getting reasonable performance at reasonable graphics levels on anything more modern. We're talking just barely getting 60fps on Spyro: Reignited Trilogy at 720p, lowest graphic preset. But that's impressive for not being a gaming laptop. Just keep your expectations in line.

The good: This thing is blitzing fast in practically every other regard. This is where the SSD and CPU really take center stage. Everything is incredibly responsive and installs are very painless. Overall usage had me forgetting I wasn't on my desktop at times, so I give this a laptop a solid A+ in that regard. Boot times are damn near instant and restarting to finish installing applications happens in under 10 seconds.

Battery life has yet to be tested very well so I can't comment too much on that just yet. I'll update when I get more usage out of the battery but from the get go, it seems pretty standard.

Screen quality is again very standard. It's not winning any beauty contests compared to a decent ISP panel but again, it's not advertising itself as being anything spectacular in that regard. You get what you pay for and with this laptop, you're paying for the SSD/CPU performance which it absolutely nails.

Style: I absolutely love the way this laptop looks. It's clean, sleek, and professional. Nothing over the top but doesn't look or feel cheap. Build quality is very solid. Obviously it's no MacBook in terms of build quality but it's also less than half the price of a MacBook so again, you get what you pay for.

Sidenotes: My first unit had an odd manufacture defect on the screen; A white blotch that was only visible under certain conditions, namely over more muddy colors like off shades of white, dark blues, etc. It was incredibly distracting but I contacted Amazon who stayed on the line with me while we discussed possible solutions with ASUS and ultimately resulted in Amazon sending me a replacement unit in less than two days. The new unit has none of these issues and looks to be exactly what I was looking for in the first place. So good on both ASUS for making a decent laptop and Amazon for honoring the exchange.",5,31,Style: Ryzen 5 | 256GB SSD,Verified Purchase,"February 19, 2020",United States

BTW there's only 1 RAM memory slot on this board and the one that came with this laptop is 8GB which means all 8GB are on this module NOT soldered on the board like it says in the Asus documentation.

B07QQB7552,RMEC3PA0B9MYP,John on the Internet,Good. Probably best for school/work,"Overall review is that this laptop is good however I do have some issues with it. I will be using this more or less for school and web surfing here and there. Not good if you would like to have some games.

When I bought this I also bought a extra 8 gb ram. Looking at the reviews and pictures, most do say that it has an extra slot for another ram. This particular model did not. If you search in the reviews, there are some question that is answered by ASUS Support and one that says ""this unit can support a max of 16 GB of RAM. It has 2 slots, 1 installed with 8 GB of RAM and 1 slot left open for an additional 8 GB."" Mine did not. Looking at the ASUS website, the specs says ""4 GB DDR4 2400MHz SDRAM Onboard memory, 1 x SO-DIMM socket for expansion, up to 12 GB SDRAM"". Here is the address : asus(dot)com/us/Laptops/ASUS-VivoBook-15-F512DA/specifications/ Don't fully trust the review answers. Take it with a grain of salt and look on the actual website for the model specs.

Screen brightness could be better. On the brightest setting while plugged in, I rate it a 6. Was expecting a 8 at most.

Battery life as of writing this, 8-17-2019 12:00pm, says 7.5 hrs at 83% battery. Probably not accurate but seems to be doing well so far and as said earlier will more or less be used for school and web surfing.",4,11,Style: Ryzen 5 | 256GB SSD,Verified Purchase,"August 17, 2019",United States
B07QQB7552,R6MGEYTLAQD5I,Felipe,Great quality laptop for the money,"I bought the Ryzen 5/ 256GB SSD variant. At $479 in Nov of 2020, with a 15'6 screen, backlit keyboard with numeric keypad and this specs, this is a fantastic laptop for the money. The quality of the screen is great and the keyboard pretty comfortable. The sound is also remarkably good, in case you need to watch something through the built-in speakers.
I installed Linux straight away, so I can't review its performance under Windows, but on Linux it works definitely great. This configuration means 8 cores, and everything got recognized and was working flawlessly from the start (at least on Arch Linux, you may get different results with more conservative distros). I haven't come around configuring and testing the fingerprint sensor yet though.
My usage is mostly browsing, office tasks, watching movies and programming.
I am not a gamer, but do play Minecraft with my son from time to time. It does work pretty well, once you reduced the max framerate from the default 160 or so to a more reasonable 30FPS. The video card setup is definitely not good if you plan to play other more graphics intensive video games, but for the ocassional game, this would also do.
As other user reported, the looks are also great, surprisingly good at this price range. It does have some Macbook vibes, which is always nice, and definitely not expected at this price.
My only negative remarks are that despite the extended keyboard, the insert key requires pressing the Function key, so there is an extra complication if you use the Ctrl+Ins, Shift+Ins for copy and paste. Also, as reported in other comments, out of the 8GB of RAM, 2 are dedicated to the video card, so you actually have 6GB for the system. Wait till you receive it, and open it to check if you have the one with a SODIMM module of 4GB. I did so and ordered an 8GB module for not much, to upgrade it to the max possible total of 12GB of RAM (10GB for the system).
All in all, another perfectly rounded laptop by Asus. At this price and specs there is really no other competitor. Very satisfied with my purchase.

B07QQB7552,RFZVKO0ZXOTTQ,pyro9k,Great laptop for browsing/music/college,"In the fall of 2019 I researched an affordable laptop with the least bloatware (important for me), decent packaging/build, reasonable hardware specs and battery life. This laptop satisfied my requirements.

SSD for fast start-up/shut-down. 256GB storage capacity for a nice amount of pictures, music and applications. A graphics chip that performs well with browsing, visuals, videos, etc. The battery serves me well as I can browse, listen to music, run word and excel for a good 3 hours to 6 hours (depending what I have running) on NOT a full charge (70% down to 20%) meaning I could get more if I use the battery from 100% down to 0%.

This is not a gaming laptop. I play Destiny 2 on PS4 but one of my friends plays on PC so I use this laptop to play Destiny once in a while and it is playable but on 720p all settings low. Still, this laptop has been awesome and super fast since I purchased it 5 months ago.

UPDATE: 7 months in, the unit began rarely freezing at boot before BIOS resulting in a blank screen, unresponsive keyboard, and would get super hot/run fan loudly. Holding the power key to kill power then powering the unit back on would randomly allow the unit to boot normally BUT... over the next several days the chances of the unit booting successfully gradually decreased to zero.
Trying to claim warranty on ASUS' website was broken so I had to resort to a claim by phone. After being on hold for 15 min I was offered a prepaid shipping label surprisingly quickly so now I'm just waiting for repairs to complete. Hopefully no one else experiences this problem.

(a bit of context: It is extremely rare for me not to be able to diagnose a computer problem and fix it myself)

UPDATE: 3 weeks later I received my laptop back from ASUS. The mobo (motherboard) was bad (as I suspected) and was replaced. It runs great as ever.

B07QQB7552,R1HCXTHQT5JA05,Max,Fast,"I’ve only had/used this laptop for a day so far. I do a decent amount of video editing and 3D modeling so if your into that, this review is for you.

The battery life on this computer is decent. When you’re using it heavily, for example, video editing and modeling (I use cinema 4d and premiere pro), the battery life is not great. You will get roughly 2-4 hours with this computer without it being plugged in.

Color accuracy isn’t great, but it’s not bad.

The computer is extremely fast for its price. The fingerprint sensor is a very nice feature. I’m yet to do heavy video editing in premiere but when it opens up, it is quick.

I used to use a Toshiba Satellite for 3D modeling. Each frame would take around 1 minute with a lot of detail. Using the exact same scene on this computer, it is now down to 20 seconds a frame. (It seems like a while but it really isn’t)

Overall I am loving this laptop. As I said it has only been my first day, but so far so good.
I will add onto this more as I continue to use this laptop.

Update: Over the past month I’ve used this laptop a bunch. For video editing, it’s pretty good. Premiere Pro 2019 runs very easily on this laptop and can do some pretty hefty editing. After effects 2020 also works great but when you want to play back your video, it doesn’t work. Cinema 4D continues to work great with alright rendering times. If you want to game, I don’t recommend this laptop.

the Boot up time is fast. System response is fast as well. although I would highly recommend you minimize any background Apps you have since the RAM is not a lot. 6GB usable , 2GB for Graphics. however, since its Dual channel, its making up for its shortcomings.

PLEASE NOTE: if you are planning to upgrade one of the RAM, you can do it but at the cost of losing the 2x4GB dual channel.

also, the Storage is upgradable, you can just buy new NVMe SSD or you could buy a microSDXC card.

- 8GB or more DDR4 RAM
- 3.0ghz+ Threaded Quad core CPU or 6-core (non threaded)
- Integrated on chip graphics
- 240GB+ SSD (NVMe prefered)

Why did I choose this, I have gone team red with AMD and the introduction of their Ryzen chips, if it's not Ryzen or Threadripper, I'm not interested in anything red, but when you're talking APU (CPU & GPU) combined, AMD has this market 100%. The last computer I built had a second generation Ryzen APU as a budget build, and that has very similar specs to this laptop. Combined with 8GB RAM and an SSD I was confident that this would be a laptop that was able to provide my son with a great learning experience for more than a year or two. It has handled everything that we've thrown at it so far. It's certainly not set up for gaming, but because of its specs, it could probably handle some low level gaming, but if that's what you're looking for in this price range, I would suggest learning to build a desktop, because there aren't gaming laptops in this price range. To address preinstalled bloatware, it wasn't terrible, I would normally do a clean Windows install, but didn't bother. Comes with a 30 day trial of McAfee virus protection, I would suggest renewing it, it's great and for a low price you can protect all your families devices for something like $40 for a year.

I’m hppy with my purchase and one of the reasons I choose this laptop was for its quick response time and its living up to my expectations!
Downside: I tried running a browser game that I use to play ages ago to test its ability to run games. For it to run smoothly I had to put the game settings between low and mid even when I adjust the Radeon settings to game mode. I was a little disappointed because I hoped I’d be able to play one or two games on this (like skyrim) but can’t say it’s given me hope since it didn’t live up to expectations for the other game. However, I didn’t purchase the laptop as a gaming pc so it’s not like I was misguided.
Overall I’m pretty happy with my purchase

Disclaimer: Havent done any exterme heavy tasking work on it yet.

Negatives:
Sticky Keys, not a very great feel (5/10)
Fan gets a bit loud (6/10)
Displa (7.4/10)
Battery Life (Browsing internet) 96%-10% 4 hours (3/10) (VERY BAD)
A little light leak (screen bleed) on top of screen near border (not noticeable most of time)
One Soldered RAM slot
Small left/right arrows that have space to be larger
Thermal Design isnt evenly distributed between laptop. Left is a freezer, right side is hot. (How could this have passed engineering design?)
Mini-sd card doesnt seem to work.

Positives:
Very Responsive
Doesnt get too hot (overall)
Lightweight
Slim Bezels
The hinge feels good (FOR NOW), hopefully it lasts more than a couple years.

B07QQB7552,R2XNYV0TU80EE4,Shared,"2 star laptop, Asus cut some corners, should be cheaper IMO.","The spec sheet looks great. 3500u quad core with the latest APU technology, SSD storage, 8gb of ram and IPS screen with fingerprint sensor. So far so good.

So what is the problem?

Display:
Display has poor brightness. You will keep this screen at 100% brightness even in the dark, I promise you that! I am writing this review from inside my house for example. I am near the window, sunlight is right on my hands and nowhere else, but the reflection that causes on the screen overpowers the screen brightness. If I didn't wear a black shirt, then that too would also reflect on the screen and overpower it. Just forget it if you want to bring this laptop outside during the day, or a brightly lit environment. My cheap Asus Chromebook has much better screen than this for 1/2 the price.

Battery:
Simply put, it resembles the battery life of budget laptops from 2013-2015. This laptop seems to use 1% of battery every 2 or 2.5 minutes. All I did now for the past 15 minutes and lost 10% battery life was download 1 short program, and wrote this review. That is unacceptable. Yes, the display screen is at 100%. The colors do look nice and the angles are great, it's an IPS screen afterall.

Backlit keyboard:
I keep those off, always have and since I value the battery life, I likely always will keep them off. Such a bummer. I really like the feature for night time use but will kill the battery even faster.

Gaming:
Yes it runs modern games on low settings when plugged in. On battery it's useless, you'd kill the battery in no time at all, so I didn't even bother to try. Some slightly older games will run pretty decent on this laptop.

So do I recommend this laptop? Yes and no.

At this price point I would say you are doing yourself a huge disservice not spending just a little more on something that has none of these problems. Or better yet, downgrade the cpu in favor of something weaker that has long battery, and better screen brightness, because believe it or not, those do exist in the $300 price range and below. They may not be windows based thou.

I hate to say it because I like AMD, thou I think this is ASUS's fault, they did not properly engineer these laptops correctly, and it shows when you open them up, wasted space that could have gone towards battery. Terrible memory layout causes bottleneck. Terrible choice of backlight. They really wanted to make a cheap laptop that looks premium on the outside but aside from the fast CPU it behaves like a super budget laptop.

Now personally, I am keeping this laptop. Parents will be the ones using this laptop. They never install programs, just surf the web, this is perfect for them.

So who is this laptop for? well...simply put, for people that will not use it to the full potential and if you need to buy your kid a windows laptop, this one will do. It is powerful enough to run demanding apps like games for very cheap.

But even for kids, if they need the laptop to last them through all their classes, they will need to plug into the wall mid day.",2,2,Style: Ryzen 5 | 256GB SSD,Verified Purchase,"July 29, 2020",United States

There were a couple of utility apps and McAfee, but that was it! I have had HP's, Dell's, and Lenovo's bogged down with so much crap from the factory, it is pretty slow from the get-go. With that said, I always take the time to reinstall a clean OS and selectively install just the drivers and utility apps I want. Bootup time is less than 10 seconds and my software runs quickly.

F.,Marred by sub-par cooling system,"This laptop performs pretty pleasantly, is nicely designed, and has some good features, but that is all unimportant with a sub-par, poorly designed cooling system. The heat pipes do not even make contact with the fan, which, instead of blowing the heat from the pipes out of an exhaust port, is instead pointed across the pipes, and not directed toward any exhaust at all. This is no secret, either - plenty of comments have been made about it, and it's easy to find a teardown that shows this asinine engineering. Because of this, the fan will run quite often under any remotely demanding workload (that it CAN handle, just not without getting hot), and the fan is not super quiet either, so noise levels are abysmal.",2,3,Style: Ryzen 5 | 256GB SSD,Verified Purchase,"July 20, 2020",United States

There should be enough processing power and RAM to breeze through basic tasks such as we surfing, watching videos and mid level games. Sadly it struggled on all tasks, and after a little research that wasn't clearly mentioned in product description I found that processing speed is drastically reduced by the system setup to extend battery life and is not something that can be turned off in settings.

I also wanted something reasonably priced that had the power, speed, and features to handle what I needed for documents, spreadsheets, .pdfs, email, web navigation, etc. This laptop with Windows 10 started up with lightning fast speed, was easy to set up, easy to download software, browsers, and applications, and easy to customize the start window, task bar, desktop, links, etc. I have been using Windows 7 at home and work, and the transition to Windows 10 was nearly seamless (user friendly interface). The navigation to folders in Windows is fast, file transfer from my old laptop was very quick, and opening web pages, creating, opening and editing files (I installed Office on this laptop) is also speedy. The display is a good size (small border), well lit, and very crisp and clear. The back lit keyboard (which can be turned off) is also a nice feature. The sound quality and graphics quality also appear to be quite good. I have not yet used it for videos, but I imagine that will be good too.

This laptop has been incredibly reliable. The battery isn't terrible, but isn't too impressive. It got me through last semesters class schedule where it would be in constant use between 8AM and 3PM, not requiring the charger until about 5 depending on the workload.

For general web browsing, word, and video watching this laptop does a great job. For gaming, not quite as much (which isn't really the intended purpose of this laptop anyway). Less intensive games run just fine, I finished a playthrough of The Elder Scrolls Oblivion purely on this laptop.

The port situation is acceptable, the inclusion of an HDMI port is a nice touch, as well as an SSD port. Plugging in a dongle for a wireless mouse leaves you with two open USB ports which is perfectly acceptable for a mobile setup. The keyboard is comfortable, and the back light does its job well, though i have it turned off to save battery throughout the day. The screen is pretty nice, with a wide range of luminosity.

Honestly, the screen is just fine. You'll see a lot of reviews knocking the screen, but for your casual user, the screen is great. I can understand if you wanted to play games on this laptop and being disappointed by the screen, but for web surfing and consuming media, the screen is clear and crisp.

The keyboard is a little scrunched due to the number pad, but the keystrokes feel good and responsive.

Hardware: It's great - the computer boots up in seconds and I like the fingerprint reader. It has very snappy load times, and I can easily have 10+ tabs open and not lose any kind of productivity/speed.

Cons:

The battery life is average, but it helps to either dim or turn off the backlit keyboard, especially when you don't need it. However, you'll probably get 6-7 hours of use on a single charge. It does charge fairly quickly though and the charger is portable.

You can upgrade the RAM and the HD on this one, but since it donsn't have an extra slot for either of those, you'd have to just replace the existing one.
Also, something I find weird about amazon is that this product was grouped with F510UA, when I bought it (an it is definitely not a slightly different version of that laptop) and now is grouped with some other laptop that definitely isn't the same, so pay attention to which model each review is talking about.",3,2,Style: Ryzen 5 | 256GB SSD,Verified Purchase,"October 3, 2019",United States

However, I ordered this based on price and the assumption that it was easily upgradeable.

First off, there is only *ONE* RAM slot. There is no ""soldered on-board"" stick.
The max RAM capacity is 12 GB, and there is only ONE space for RAM. So the max RAM you can actually install is 8 GB.

Second, there is a space for a 2.5 "" internal drive, but you will NOT get any cables or parts to install one.
The necessary cable is a very specific SATA ribbon cable you'll have to find on Ebay. Have fun with that.

Ordered this laptop with an extra stick of RAM and an extra SSD drive, and can't install either.

It's pretty clear that the reviews and QA's you'll find on this page are shared with another variation of this model that may be more easily upgradeable, and that's pretty ridiculous.

B07QQB7552,R3MXN5DVB1ND44,Balamurugan,Amazing Laptop For Work,"Had this laptop for around a month now.

Here is how it is,

Pros:
- Great Screen
It has great image quality and nice brightness levels.

-Nice keyboard
It's comfortable to type on and is full size

-Lightweight

-Runs like a charm
All work-related stuff runs amazing and is good for light gaming.

Cons-

Battery life
It has a really bad battery life it can last up to 6 hours use on the bare minimum.
I'm talking full saver mode and low brightness.

Gaming-
Gaming on this can be done lightly but makes the laptop loud and overheat.

Overall this laptop is definitely the best(if it's under 550$), it gets the job done and can lightly run games too!",5,2,Style: Ryzen 5 | 256GB SSD,Verified Purchase,"January 9, 2021",United States
B07QQB7552,R1ZRJOVEWTBG25,Myke Nyte,Best bang for your buck!,"I was in the hunt for compact laptop w/ decent light video editing. After spending long hours watching/reading reviews, I came to a decision on this model. I was looking for a portable PC that can edit videos on the go while i'm not at my desktop. At first, i was hesitant about the AMD processor due to being an INTEL guy all my life. Long story short, this device has impressed me. The Ryzen 5 processor w/ 8 gb ram did the job and with the help of the Vega 8, this laptop prevented any frame skips, etc. while editing. The screen isn't the best for photo editing but it did the job IMO. Boot ups and your everyday tasks are fast and will not disappoint you. I wouldn't recommend this for gaming but in can handle light gaming @ lower res. While editing videos, i did notice a bit of fan noise but no throttling. I think this is definitely a great buy under $500.

One thing to keep in mind that the 8gb ram is a dual channel w/ 4gb on board and another 4 gb that's upgradable. I wouldn't recommend upgrading 1 stick as the processor relies on ram sharing and you wouldn't want an uneven amount of RAM.",5,2,Style: Ryzen 5 | 256GB SSD,Verified Purchase,"March 1, 2020",United States

I don't use it for gaming, so if you're wondering about that I have no opinions on it. It is light and because it uses a SSD it is extremely portable.

The Wifi has been dropping regularly recently, though a couple of machines in the same room don't seem to have the problem.

Lastly the Display goes dead every now and then and a few restarts are required before it start showing up again. This problem started a few months after I bought it and was the earliest of the 3 problems.

B07QQB7552,R1NVPDFI9GBXIY,W. Blackford,Mislabeled and not worth the price,"This is a complaint mostly about Amazon - this computer is filed under ""gaming computers"" when you search on Amazon. That may lead someone to believe that this laptop is good for gaming. It's not. In fact, if you search the questions for gaming, you will find every answer saying it is NOT good for gaming.

So the question then becomes; ""Why in the world would I pay $500 for a laptop that can only do what a laptop half the price can do?""

The answer is, you shouldn't. $500 may not be a lot to people, but it's a lot to me. I thought this computer would let me play a few games, work on it, and run very smoothly because I wasn't asking it to do much at all.

It can't even run a game from 5 years ago without stuttering. I installed a few apps, like Google Drive and Steam and some other basic things, and the computer is ALREADY slow. I've had it for less than a week and I can feel it chugging along when I click an icon to open something.

If I wanted a $500 Chromebook that can only browse the internet, that's what I would have gotten.

I'm sure this computer is fine, but it is NOT worth $500. Not even close. Don't let the ""big"" display and the backlit keyboard seduce you. There is absolutely nothing special about this computer.

And per other reviews I've since read, the port deteriorates within a year such that the cord will not make a firm connection, and the laptop will only charge sporadically. But, after I used it for a couple of months, another member of the family pushed harder on the power connector, and it suddenly seated firmly and deeply.

It has a large screen despite its size, a full keyboard with numeric keypad, and it's light and thin.
It always struck me how fast it powers on, and how easy to log in using the fingerprint reader. I can go from full power down to logged in in matter of seconds with no fuss. I don't even see the need for sleep state anymore.
The keyboard is easy to type on, as best as it can be for a laptop I guess. My only gripe is the location of the power button, located at the top right. I would have preferred it to be even more isolated to prevent accidental pressing of it when using the keypad. But it's not a big deal. It would have been better if there is a full size SD card reader (my camera uses full size SD cards, so it's good not to carry an extra adapter). Finally an ethernet port will be perfect, as I always prefer ethernet to WiFi whenever possible. But for most, I don't think these will be deal-breakers.

Overall, has performed very well. No real issues encountered other than a few times in first week or two, there were perhaps 3-5 occasions of browser screen blacking out for a second when it refreshed. Haven't encountered that issue in several months since.

Boot time is good - approx 6 seconds from hitting power button to being logged in with fingerprint ID. I only use plugged in so cannot comment on battery life or other performance throttling to save power. Has enough usb & other slots.

Works well enough for light gaming, though I haven't tried anything post-2017 release.

Would buy again if on sale. Originally got for $479. Main drawback is only 256gb SSD & no pre-installed cables for adding SSD/HDD. Added micro SD to free up some HD space, but will be limited if plan to have more than a few games installed simultaneously.

1. This Laptop is suppose to be up-gradable to 12 GB memory ram but it came with one 8 GB stick and one slot only so makes the computer not up-gradable. Not very good for gaming (although its not a gaming laptop in anyway)

B081V6W99V,RS7446V5P327P,Richard,GREAT CASUAL USER LAPTOP,"Ok, just to get everything out in one sentence: This is the perfect laptop for the CASUAL laptop user! Which is a good thing!

This is a great little laptop! for $200 this is a steal. 64 gigabytes is enough for windows 10. If you get a 128GB mini SD card, then this laptop will work great for you. Now if you plan on using this to store pictures, videos and other files, for awhile, then you will run out of space (with the laptop alone). But with a mini SD card or a flash drives to store your files, you'll be fine.

If you are a heavy computer user and need it for heavy video editing, photoshop or a heavy gamer, then obviously this won't work for you. I use windows movie maker. It works just fine. This can play light games or games that have been released from the early 2000's (if you play on Steam).. Newer games that need Gforce and what not.. Obviously not. This laptop is for the casual user, but can hold its grounds when using other programs.

I have used adobe elements for video editing.. Does it work. yes, it does! is it the best computer to use it on.. haha, no. But it does work on this laptop, though this isn't the idea computer you'd used a program on like this. But if you're on a tight budget and don't mind the laptop taking a few extra moments to process everything, then go for it.

The keyboard and the mouse pad works like butter. I love typing on this thing. I've typed on several 11.6"" laptops and had trouble, but I have no problem typing on this.

GREAT LAPTOP and VERY HAPPY!!",5,660,"Style: 11.6"" | Intel N4000 | 64GB Storage",Verified Purchase,"August 4, 2019",United States
B081V6W99V,R18MZW78YY2W8F,Ken,Top Choice in this segment,"This is the only ultra-book I could find with a 64gb ssd, 4gb RAM, weighed only 2 pounds (actually 2.1) and cost $200. If your expectations are reasonable (i.e. don't expect to find a large screen, don't expect to run intense programs or games) then I think you will be happy with this.

The notebook comes with Windows 10S (not windows 10) which can be upgraded free and easily. If the upgrade is not made, then you are limited to the programs/apps in windows' store which is not very comprehensive. The only issue here is that the Windows 10 version the upgrade goes to is 64 bit (not 32) which has compatibility issues with some older programs.

I found the eMMC disk drive to be fast, the computer boots in a few seconds. There is a Micro SD slot. 256GB micro sd card is only around $25 and is immensely helpful in increasing available storage (buy a name brand only; i.e. microcenter, sandisk, pny, crucial, kingston, etc etc). The internal eMMC drive or the RAM can not be upgraded.

WiFi is strong, the screen is only 11.5"" but is very bright and has very good resolution and color. The USB ports are V 3.x. The keyboard does not feel cramped or compromised in any way despite the small size of the notebook. Too bad it does not have a trackpoint which would be very helpful in navigating more precisely on the small screen.

I have only had this so far for a week so I can not comment on durability. The card slot seems a bit flimsy.

I have been unable to get anything near the ""whole day"" claim on a battery charge. 6 hours is about it but obviously that is still very good.

Overall I believe this is a very good choice especially for this price range; this laptop is not much heavier than a tablet but is much more useful. Also, Windows 10 is far more versatile than the Chrome OS, in my opinion anyway.",4,387,"Style: 11.6"" | Intel N4000 | 64GB Storage",Verified Purchase,"November 10, 2019",United States

I added a 200gb micro sd for data storage and have a 2 tb slim USB HD for more extensive things like video. I haven't found much that this mighty mouse will not do. If you need am inexpensive portable Linux machine, look no further.

All you kind folks having winows problems on this laptop, save yourself a boat load of headaches and jump off the Microsoft bandwagon. Try linux. Mint is a great place to start. It will easily handle your web, office and email. I have even edited photos with the (free) equivalent of Photoshop and Lightroom ... GIMP and Darktable.

B081V6W99V,R3UHWJ6C4ST530,MI in DC,Zips Right Along,"I really, really like this little gizmo. Looks good, feels as solid as one can expect, nice response feel on the keys, crisp display and bright, and lightning fast... for a reason. First things first, I ripped Windows out of this mini laptop shortly after powering it up. Why? Windows is a memory and resource hog. Secondly, the amount of information they want just to run the laptop outside Windows S mode is ridiculous. Hence, Windows had to go, so it I took it out.

In place of Windows I installed Manjaro Linux, based off the Arch Linux distro, using the Xcfe interface system. Both are considered light weight and just seemed perfect for this mini laptop. The OS slid right in without a single problem, it picked up all the hardware on boot-up, and the response times proved better than I hoped. As a test of the battery, I loaded up Youtube with 15 hours of videos and let it run. After nearly exhausting the 15 hours of videos, the laptop battery finally gave up. It impressed me since it played for 14 hours and 27 minutes non-stop. Moreover, the speakers sounded much better than I thought they would. A little tinny, but what could anyone really expect? The laptop never got too warm, either, considering it is a fanless system. It just powered through without a hiccup.

After ten days of regular use it seems rock solid. The shakedown period ran without a hitch. The distro comes with automatic updates, so the OS is kept fresh and update. The WiFi range is quite good. I remained connected to my WiFi for just about fifty feet, and the signal needed to pass through walls. The camera is okay, but to be honest I do not use it much if at all. I simply tested it. At just over two pounds, it travels well in my backpack and I use it during my commutes to and from the office. LibreOffice runs like a champ. GIMP runs like a champ. Audicty runs like a champ. KPatience is quick and fun. Firefox with extensions is incredibly fast... faster than on my main desktop.

This is a great little mini laptop and, with the Manjaro OS changes, is worth more than purchase price. I highly recommend it since it proved so amenable to modification. I would definitely buy again.

6 Months Later... I still love this mini-laptop. I use it almost every day. Mostly I use it for writing, streaming music to a Bluetooth speaker, and a little web surfing, and I could not be happier with this machine. I made the right choice of swapping out the OS. I have recommended it to others, and I know of at least 3 other people who purchased one. They also seemed pleased, but I don't want to speak directly for them.",5,159,"Style: 11.6"" | Intel N4000 | 64GB Storage",Verified Purchase,"August 14, 2019",United States
B081V6W99V,RMT52N2PBI3OA,Robert Ullrich,Pleasantly surprised and imprressed,"I bought the ASUS Vivo book to replace an HP Stream I purchased at a local chain. As an author, albeit not well-known, I use a laptop primarily for writing. I also create my own graphics and maintain my website. The Stream quickly ran out of storage space, making it a constant (weekly) endeavor to free up space. Then - the death knoll. Not enough space to update Windows 10, and Microsoft would no longer offer service or support for my version of 10.

I was unfamiliar with ASUS, having located the Vivo on Amazon. The specs were sufficient for my needs. The bonus of Office 365 for a year was a plus as a 19-year user of Office. Slim and lightweight, easy to carry. Graphics are good, as is sound and compatibility with my desktop.

B081V6W99V,RCGPZF4JYUITQ,George Heath,"Great unit, but I got a lemon. (It Happens)"," ASUS makes great products and when it comes to electronics every now and then you get one that doesn't work.
This was my case..
The instruction manual recommends charging for at least 3 hours before running it off the battery alone.
I let it charge for close to four hours and it said it was 100% fully charged.
BUT when I unpluged the power cord the unit shut right off.
And it would not start up unless I plug the power cord back in.
I'm guessing the battery was bad or something along those lines..
Anyways,
While I had it plugged in and powered up it seemed to be really nice...
It was fast.
Setup was easy.
It has an excellent display and sound.
I have nothing negative to say about this laptop other than the one I received was a lemon and would not power up unless it was plugged in.

I ended up returning it the next day and ordered a different laptop.

B081V6W99V,R2LU8WDUYNRKS4,Alessandro AD,Perfect portable typing and research station,"Wow wow wow. I can't find enough good things to say about this portable powerhouse. I'm a pretty hardcore gamer who also uses a lot of graphics intensive programs like Photoshop and Unreal 4. This laptop... is not for that.

It's for those times away from your high-end programs, where you need 10 chrome tabs open in a coffee shop while you're experimenting with Microsoft Word layouts. It's for when you're out in the woods and want to sort and organize the photos on your camera's SD right then and there. It's for trips where you want to travel light, but still want the world at your finger tips.

OK, OK, enough flowery language. Let's get to the pros / cons:

Pros:
-The keyboard feels great, with a nice balance of being chunky and ""clicky"" while still being compact. Once you get used to its size, it's pretty easy to get close to your fastest typing speeds with minimal errors.
-This thing is really light. Maybe I'm too sued to heavier laptops, but seriously, this thing is effortless to bring around. Throw it in a backpack, tuck it under your shoulder, do whatever. This thing is pretty durable from what I can tell, so all that lightness doesn't come at the cost of having to gingerly secure it in a special compartment. Any ol' laptop bag / pocket will do!
-The battery life is great! Maybe I'm too used to being tethered to outlets by more power-hungry machines, but I was able to get hours of typing and Chromeing out of this thing. The key I've found (as with most machines) is to keep the brightness a bit low when you're not plugged it, it can make a big difference.
-ASUS has always made my favorite laptops and this one is no exception. If you're a fan of ASUS' work, you'll find everything you know and love about and ASUS packed into a tiny package.
-The ports, lordy, the ports! So many ports in such a tiny machine.
-The screen is far brighter and more colorful than I was expecting. My other laptop is a ""state-of-the-art"" ROG Strix II, with a high color accuracy, high refresh-rate display... the issue is they never calibrate said displays and they always end up coming out sickly yellow, requiring hours of manual adjusting. Not this little fighter though! Bright and beautiful right out of the box! Color pureists will notice things can get a bit washed out, but it's certainly preferable to the yellow tint of other machines.
-The price is the best I've seen for the quality of machine you're getting. This thing is durable, sturdy and built for a few specific things it excels at. It's definitely given my productivity a boost and is well worth the investment.
-There was pretty minimal bloatware on the machine, which was great.
-Office 360 for a year is a HUGE plus. Also be sure to upgrade the machine to full Windows 10 (from S), the process is free, fast and jarringly painless.
Cons:
-Even 64 GBs is not a a huge amount of space. This is definitely more of a document and cloud oriented device. If you're hoping to put your entire music library on this thing you're going to need to expand the storage. If storage isn't an issue, than this is probably the book for you!
-Similarly the 4 GBs of RAM can make this little engine chug sometimes. Don't expect it to be happy with running 20 chrome tabs at once,n or for it to instantly load pages the moment you click them. It's certainly fast enough, but as someone who's coming from a 16 GB machine the little differences can be noticeable.
-The touch pad is ... OK. It's not terrible, but (much like all touch pads these days) it loses tracking now and then and lacks any real buttons for the left and right. I never much enjoyed touch pads to begin with so maybe I'm biased.

Closing thoughts: If you like what you've read, read more reviews and honestly take the dive. If you're looking for a durable portable typer, that can do a little bit of everything this is your machine!

More closing thoughts: A story for you, about ASUS laptops...

In winter I got an ROG Strix II, a very powerful and very pricey machine. It was maddening getting the thing to work properly. Getting photoshop to play nice with the dual graphics. Getting the screen to not look yellow. Getting the damn speakers to not crank the bass. Many of these issues are still unresolved and frankly though I love the hardware I'm more than likely going to have to start from square one with that thing.

I was all emotionally prepared to go through the same process with this little trail-blazer. I was ready to troubleshoot and troubleshoot and finally get something that mostly did what I needed. To my absolute delight, this machine seems to be the last bastion of PCs that do everything right, everything the way they're supposed to, right out of the box. I haven't had to troubleshoot a single thing about this beautiful laptop and honestly couldn't be happier. If you're looking for something portable, something durable, something to up your productivity and most of all something easy to work with, this is the laptop for you.",5,45,"Style: 11.6"" | Intel N4000 | 64GB Storage",Verified Purchase,"October 24, 2019",United States

B081V6W99V,RFABYPHG8XZWF,Ivan,It worth the price. Empty slot for adding NVME M.2,"I really liked this little machine and for the price, in my opinion is a steal. It is like 20% faster than my mini PC which sports an Intel Celeron N3450 Quad-core. Per my tests with the 64GB eMMC included, even Windows 10 (v2004) is snappy. I also ran Linux on it with no issues, except that the wireless driver needs to be installed manually(tested on Mx Linux for instance). The sequential reading for the Sandisk eMMC is 316 MB/s and 154 MB/s writing.

Once I booted up on the Windows installed, switched from Windows 10 in S Mode to Windows 10 Home for free in the Microsoft App Store and went ahead and activated the Office 365 subscription included for free(1 year). After that, I cleaned up the disk and installed everything from scratch. The drivers can be downloaded from the official Asus homepage. I had zero issues with Windows 10 20H1(v2004) but when tested version 20H2 (v2009), I had issues with the WIFI connection, so left 20H1.

Something interesting on this machine is that there's an empty slot for adding our own SSD NVME M.2. I didn't' test it myself as I didn't have a spare SSD, but there are a few videos where someone could put in a 1TB SSD.

The BIOS version included was v302, so one of the first things I did was to update to the latest version v306.

I wish it had a backlit keyboard and an IPS screen. That would made it perfect for my needs. It's also very well built to be a cheap laptop.

Overall, I would buy it again.

[UPDATE 2-3-2021]

I installed a 512GB SSD and it worked like a charm. The reading/writing speeds are around 1700/1200 MB/s respectively. I just added a screenshot.

I did a triple boot (Windows 10, MX Linux and Chrome OS) using Refind and all is working fine.

EDIT:

I replaced the wireless card with an Intel Wifi6 AX200(Amazon B07SH6GV5S). This new card does not required me to install drivers at all on Windows 10(although intel recommends to install the latest driver version they provide and I did that), Linux (Kernel 5.8) or Chrome OS, which it's a plus for me. Also, tested on Windows 10 20H2 and found zero issues. Really happy with it.

B081V6W99V,R1XJR9D8TQP8D3,Moises Alonso,Horrible Piece of Junk,"Worst purchase ever and experience ever, less than a month after I purchased this PC for my son the power supply died and ASUS refused to replace it. They said I had to send them back the $5.00 power supply before they would replace it. I Had to buy another power supply just to get the PC up and running. After I sent the power supply back they claimed that they never got it. Now mind you the defective power supply was just being shipped across town. The claimed they never got it and that I was responsible to provide them a tracking number. So let me see if I understand this, you want me to spend about $20.00 for shipping and a tracking number to replace a $5.00 power supply. I figured they would just get it since they service center is in Pomona California and not in China. They claim they never got it.

Now 7 month later the whole computer is dead. Will not power up, screen is dead yet the Hard Drive light is on. ASUS answer, send the computer back to them and if they determine it was not dropped or abused they might repair it.

B081V6W99V,R32LIIOI1KNLQL,iblyth07,Chromebook Compromise Worth Making,"I rather foolishly gave up my very capable Lenovo Thinkpad for a massive HP Omen when I committed to getting rid of my console gaming systems. And love my 17in Omen as I do, I'm damned if that thing is going to travel with me anywhere I need to get some kind of work done when on vacation. Most of my work is cloud based, so I don't need a whole mess of hardware to run what I do. I like Chromebooks, but I did miss the Microsoft ecosystem when I used them, I found. This little thing looks to be just the niche I needed. It's dead small; I carry it around with my iPad Pro for editing photos and videos, and together they almost vanish in a bag. The battery life is pretty spectacular for the work I do on the regular. I did try, just for fun, putting some Photoshop and Lightroom projects on it, just to see how it handled them; eh - better than I thought, but definitely wouldn't recommend. Maybe in a pinch, but I wouldn't lean too heavily on it. The track pad is nothing special. I did eventually concede and buy a wireless mouse to use with it whilst on vacation, but that's probably down to my impatience on certain things. It was definitely better than some trackpads I've used, but nothing like my old Lenovo...(moment of silence for Thinky) All in all, though, I would recommend this to anyone for whom a Chromebook is a viable solution, but doesn't always go where constant connectivity is possible, so local word processing is a must.

BTW, I can't really speak to how the Vivobook runs and works in S mode, like it comes out of the gate. I needed some applications that the store doesn't supply, so I switched out of it almost immediately. But I don't doubt it would work just fine, if not even faster. But I never grew fond of Internet Explorer, or the newer browser, so S mode had to go.

Even so, 5/5, would highly recommend - just know what you need it for, and if it can meet those requirements. With those in mind, this'll probably do you just fine 👍",5,17,"Style: 11.6"" | Intel N4000 | 64GB Storage",Verified Purchase,"March 8, 2020",United States

B081V6W99V,RDM5ZQPROSY9Z,MC,"Good bang for the price, *BUT* has problems","UPDATED FOR LOWER SCORE: So while I think if it works, it's decent for the price, the issue is that over the past few months, I've had unfortunate issues with the laptop just out of the blue not wanting to boot, nor will it charge, or even display the battery light. Literally dead as a brick.

However if you let it sit for ~24-36 hours, *then* plug it in, suddenly it will work just fine for another few weeks, boots up and charges like normal, until it happens again of course. I should have sent it in when it first happened, but I didn't and I'm stupid.

It always has (at least so far) come back just fine, suddenly being without a computer for a day or two is frustrating, so I would advise caution when getting this laptop, and if it suddenly turns into a brick on you, just send it back and don't deal with the issue, and get something else. I've seen too many people with this same issue get another one that also doesn't work right.

Original review:
So, while I think this is a good product for the price, I think it's important to know what you're getting in to, and know what you'll be using it mainly for.

To start with the good:

-Product is *very* light weight, incredibly easy for transporting, but doesn't feel cheap. Great choice if you need to take it with you constantly, IE student, for work, etc.
-Boots quickly
-I do think the battery is decent. Watching video for hours on end, or doing a lot of things while music on, etc, will definitely shorten the 'all day' claim, but it's not bad for general use, and you'll get *most* of the day (also that all depends on long your day is, right?).
-SD card slot for a little extra storage
-Keyboard is good for a small laptop. Normally, in my experience, they are very cramped, this one isn't bad.

To think about:

-It's not speedy. Watching videos and general web browsing and everyday stuff is about it, I wouldn't even feel very comfortable with 'lite' gaming, so if you think you'll give some of that a shot.... I really wouldn't.
-Space is not great. Half of your space is already taken up by the OS, so doesn't leave you with more than ~30 gb. Sd card slot helps, but I would recommend some other kind of external drive or something

All in all, if you just need a windows laptop for everyday casual use, and want something very easy to take around with you, I absolutely recommend this one - I use mine all day long for normal browsing and streaming video + music,, but if you think you're looking for something for heavier use, maybe some gaming, or something speedier to run more intense programs, maybe spend a little more on another product.",2,6,"Style: 11.6"" | Intel N4000 | 64GB Storage",Verified Purchase,"June 16, 2020",United States
B081V6W99V,R1F9ADYT8D702F,Amazon Customer,Great light-weight notebook!,"This notebook is great! We got one for each of our kids for their schoolwork, and my wife liked it so much I got one for her as well. These work so much better than the HP stream!! The build quality is nice, and the battery lasts all day! I took one on a business trip where we were doing a lot of document collaboration, typing all day long. It lasted all day!

I highly recommend getting a micro sd card to store all your files on, leaving the small (64gb) hard drive for programs only.

Some people have complained about the laptop suddenly not turning on. We have experienced that from time to time, and don't know what causes it. The solution is to hold the power button down for about 40 seconds, release it, and then press it again normally. It usually fixes the problem.

These computers are not for gaming, heavy photo editing, or video editing (though my kids do make stop-motion lego videos with them). They are meant for internet browsing, creating and editing documents, watching videos, and writing emails.

The webcam is slightly better than awful, but it gets the job done for zoom, skype, etc. The audio is good, and the realtek software allows you to select whether you have connected headphones, a headset, or microphone. This allows you to plug in a microphone for a zoom call, but use the computer speakers for listening.

We are very pleased with this computer for this price!

He plays a game that we installed called the adventure Academy that is educational. And he seems to play Roblox just fine. We haven’t used it much without it being plugged in at his computer desk, but it is very light and portable, we actually use something very similar in the school systemA great portable notebook for grade school and elementary school kids. I recommend using an online drive like Microsoft one drive, Google Drive to store your files and to free up space. This is no bigger than a sheet of printer paper, which makes it very convenient to fit in the backpacks, I do recommend using a laptop sleeve when storing it in a backpack",4,9,"Style: 11.6"" | Intel N4000 | 64GB Storage",Verified Purchase,"August 25, 2019",United States

They do NOT have an address for repairs so I sent it to corp w/all the data. Now they say they don't know where the item is . They apparently have not read my 3-4 emails because their responses to mine are completely non sequitur. I wonder if anyone is there or if the customer service response is simply computer generated. It is as bad as their help page. ""A circular maze of blah blah."" Their return (RMA# link) didn't work and they have no tech repair address to return the laptop for repairs.

B081V6W99V,R1V2FY6RFHVB1,AHMED ABBASI,It was everything I wanted and then some!,"I’m a final year medical student and I was really struggling to use my 7 year old laptop. I was hoping it would be good enough to just study for my last board exam before graduating but it couldn’t even open web pages reliably! And literally took 5 mins to just turn on.

I found this laptop on amazon and watched a ton of review videos. It was super cheap so I was wary, I was concerned it would be unreliable. But ultimately I went for it, and boy was that a great call.

It comes with a free year of office so in my head I knock $80 off the price because I was paying for office anyways. So that knocks the price down to $190 for this laptop. At $190 this is an incredible value proposition!

It has a monster battery life and it’s great for.

- Webpages
- Osmosis
- Boards and Beyond
- OnlineMeded
- Uworld
- NBME practice exams
- Anki, without the media files though
- MyEras and everything else regarding license applications and residency. You can open a ton of tabs at once with no issues at all.
- I definitely suggest buying a small SD card and using that to store everything off the actual emc thing.

Some minor issues

It’s $190 so it’s not gonna be a MacBook Pro or anything. But the issues are minor if you’re just looking for something to study with and take care of basic computer work.

- trackpad gets a bit stuck occasionally but nothing that causes a major issue.
- keyboard isn’t backlit but that’s not something you can expect at this price point.
- it’s most useful in S mode I think, I haven’t tried to take it out of S mode because I’m not sure how well it would handle it. And it works well now so I don’t feel the need to try.

When I was looking for reviews I was worried about the compatibility with the programs I would need to use. If you’re in med school and you just need something cheap and reliable to study. I give this a 100% endorsement for the price point. I’m very pleased with this purchase, so much that I’m writing my first review!

I think this would work well for most other uses as well but as I’ve never used it in any other capacity I can’t really speak to that.

B081V6W99V,R2LVPWFS3DEJ88,Reviewy McReviewerson,Great for what it is,"For what this is supposed to be and for roughly $200, it's fantastic. This isn't a high performance gaming laptop (or really any kind of gaming laptop) and it would be difficult to do precise graphic design work. However, for internet access and word processing and all of your everyday computer uses, it's one of the best you can get.

This runs smooth and feels very snappy due to the solid-state drive, and Windows 10 works well. Streaming movies/shows like through Netflix or YouTube works great.

If you want to install programs that aren't on the Windows app store, you'll need to disable ""S mode"", but this is easy and quick to do. Just Google ""disable S mode"" and you'll find the steps easy enough.

64 Gbs is more than enough for windows, web surfing, movie streaming, and word processing. However, I wanted to store some photos and other media, so I picked up a 256Gb micro SD card and it seems to work very well. These are relatively inexpensive ($30 or so) and couldn't be easier to install - just insert into the micro SD slot until it clicks.

The screen is small for a laptop, but if you've been working with only a smartphone screen for a while like I had been, it seems huge. 😂

The Good:

-Inexpensive
-Easy setup
-Quiet keyboard
-Nice, clear picture
-Plays streamed movies well (Hulu, Prime, and YouTube tested)
-The battery lasted for HOURS (so far). I initially charged it for the recommended 3 hours before using it.
-Hooks up fine to a hotspot and wifi
-Works well with collegiate school work (I am 100% online and mostly use Microsoft 365/Office/Word/PowerPoint etc.)
-Lightweight & compact

The Bad:

-The screen is GLOSSY
-The touchpad lags when I'm scrolling for longer periods
-Low internal storage space (I save on various clouds but you will definitely need external storage space for apps/updates)

Overall, it is very basic and perfect for those light users like myself. It's inexpensive, user-friendly, and decent for the price. It is lightweight and compact.

There are obvious drawbacks to the computer, as it is truly intended for low-cost accessibility. I have since upgraded to a newer laptop as my needs demanded, but this cheapie will definitely be kept around for a good while due to its compact size and meeting basic task fulfillment. Excellent product for those who, like me, needed this laptop for mostly school purposes. As a media device, it falls short, but this is expected due to the price and specs. Screen quality is pretty good, but audio quality falls behind. Still the device is perfectly audible in a single occupancy setting. Most people would probably use headphones in a public setting anyway, so audio isn't as much of a concern I doubt if this is the laptop you're looking to buy. Don't expect to be running any kind of demanding software or any games that aren't Minesweeper. There's a serviceable amount of storage on the drive, but not much; heavy files will fill her up quick.

Nice construction, lightweight and compact, and beautiful design. I especially LOVE the inclusion of the USB-C port, which I will use to connect to a portable external monitor. For every day tasks around the house, this fits my purposes perfectly.

Update 1/15/21 - a few things - the product description mentions ""backlit keyboard"" but I can confirm this model definitely does not have it. Also, the USB-C port delivers power to another device and also transmits data, but does not output video to an external monitor.

Started out just fine, too. I was able to carry it anywhere I needed, because the design leaves it VERY lightweight, and the battery life was pretty decent.
Or, rather, the battery life used to be decent. About a month or so in, the battery stopped charging. At least, the laptop SAYS it doesn't charge. I've done a few test runs to see if it's charging and just...not registering that it is, but the conclusion is still up in the air.
As it is, I'm stuck connected to a power outlet, since the battery life is stuck at about 12 or 20%. It says it won't charge, the battery isn't a removable one so I can't just replace it to see if that's the issue, and I've followed about 10 different guides online to see if it's some program issue and none of them have fixed it.

It's *extremely* light compared to other similarly-sized laptops I've used. The keyboard is decent and has good key size/spacing so you can do normal typing without feeling like you need to compensate for the size of the keyboard. Performance is adequate for most everyday tasks; surfing the web and reading/answering emails.

The only negatives are the screen and touchpad. The screen is just ""ok."" It doesn't seem to have great contrast even when adjusted using the Intel Graphics app for this hardware. The display is also just not quite as crisp as other laptops I've used.

By far the biggest negative is the touchpad. It seems to randomly stop tracking when you move the mouse around the screen or try to scroll using two fingers. Sometimes it works fine, but intermittently (enough to be annoying at every usage), it stops responding, then starts up again a second later. I've read many discussion boards and it seems this is a known issue with ASUS touchpads. All Windows updates are being automatically installed and it says it's up to date. I tried uninstalling/reinstalling drivers (including the ASUS Smart Gestures app), changing the Windows settings for the touchpad by setting it to maximum sensitivity but the problem persists. It's not quite bad enough to suffer the restocking fee and return it, but it really does need to be corrected by ASUS. I have no idea if it's a hardware or software issue.

I would say overall it's a decent laptop, but if I were doing it over again, I'd probably look elsewhere primarily due to the annoyance of the touchpad.",3,2,"Style: 11.6"" | Intel N4000 | 64GB Storage",Verified Purchase,"March 6, 2020",United States

I had some trouble with Wi-Fi drivers installing properly using Manjaro/Arch and gave up before going too far down the rabbit hole. Mint works perfectly using the Xfce edition, and I’ve got i3 windows manager installed next to that and it’s flawless. Drivers seem to work out of the box (with the correct distro at least). Battery life is so good - I’ve never gotten past 50% before my nightly charge.

As a point of pride I didn’t even let it boot to Windows before ripping it out and putting Linux on, so I can’t speak to that, but you definitely get a great bang for your buck running dainty Linux vs resource gobbling Windows. Hard drive is big enough that I didn’t feel the need to get a microsd, though there is a port for one. I still have 33 GiB free after the OS and all of my tools.

No fans to make noise, no moving parts really which is nice if you like it quiet and clean. Despite this the bottom gets only pleasantly warm but nowhere near hot or uncomfortable with a heavy load. It’s very light at about two pounds, and the size is big enough to not feel cramped while still fitting in practically any bag.

There’s plenty of ports despite the small size, and the the inclusion of HDMI is surprising but welcome. The keyboard feels good. The touchpad is fine (though with i3 or similar windows manager I don’t need to use it much). I even got the webcam and mic to work with out of the box drivers.

The screen is very glossy, but the range of brightness is good and so far I haven’t been too bothered by reflections. Everything is plastic to keep it lightweight. It feels well built, not flimsy. I wouldn’t trust it to hold up to rough handling, but I’m not worried about it jostling about in my book bag.

For example, 10 keys ( f1-f12) DO NOT WORK, but for the sake of my time and sanity I am only going to cover a few.
BRIGHTNESS- when I try to turn down the brightness, it takes me back to previous page and repeat what I already read and the turn up brightness button don't even work at all.
VOLUME- I can't turn the volume up or down, I every time I press the key to turn the volume down it goes to a full screen and this mambo jumbo data crap pops up. The volume up key dont work at all so does the mute button. If I have to manually turn everything up and down what is the point of having all these useless keys on here?
MUTE- the mute key doesn't even work at either. On top of that this computer was supposed to be a touch screen too, not the case. I bought this because I saw some good reviews, and it was touch screen supposedly. Y'all must be the ones writing your own reviews for this product or something because there is no way people didn't catch these issues. BUYERS BEWARE.

I purchased this laptop for my son, with schooling now online I had hoped this would be the right size, touch screen abilities and capacity for his needs. He is online for 6 hours a day with breaks for elementary schooling. They play a lot of games as homework and the touch screen was essential.

Firstly, the package arrived on time although the shipping was not updated until 2 days before it was to be delivered and caused a lot of anxiety as it arrived the day before classes began. So set up was literally right before class began.

Battery: First class was only 90 minutes long, and alread the battery indicator said low battery and slowed down. Attached plug in and allowed full charge. After removing plug it still died just as quickly.

Setup: It was an easy step by step setup as any other laptop. The pain came in the updates, it had over 18 listed and it took 90 minutes for the first one to update. So I walked away and set the computer for restart when complete.

Restart: It did not restart. It did not turn back on. It indicated the battery was dead and there was no power. I pluged it in to charge for 4 hours and still nothing. Another 4 hours and nothing. Over night and nothing.

By this time my son had missed a whole class and I was frantically trying to find anything to connect him.

the screen resolution is fine but the screen feels a bit.... odd. i can't put my finger on it. the video card isn't a beast, nor do I need one, but it feels like the refresh rate was obviously low.
2 gigs of ram is enough for what I need, but barely. Getting a windows license was a headache, it didn't come with one and the support was bad.

The parts are matching each other precisely. When you hold it, it feels firm and sturdy. When you use the keyboard, It's actually better than a lot of other more expensive machines. Except, some times some keys will produce squeaky noise. I added some lube and it works just fine. The screen is a little warm.

Very often, I will have more than 10 chrome tabs and multiple office software opened up, it worked just fine. The overall experience is very good, snappy, I never had a single chance when the system is breaking down or non-responsible. I mainly used it for office purpose.

Talking about the performance, it is very good for it's price. Look at the images attached. I benchmarked it using PCmark 10 and it scored 1500+ while the latest surface go score 1800+. However, the surface devices will cost your twice more. 4GB RAM is enough for office purpose, as the windows 10 is efficient at managing the RAM. Also, Microsoft are still selling a 4GB RAM device in it's main product line.",4,Helpful,"Style: 11.6"" | Intel N4020 | 64GB Storage",Verified Purchase,"February 24, 2021",United States

Did not even last for a full year!!!! The laptop just suddenly wouldn't turn on, no lights nothing. Tried rebooting, holding down the power button...etc Just up and died like a goldfish got from a fair. Bit of good advice, spend your hard earned money on a better laptop than this cheap, unreliable hunk of plastic.

I'm mostly just using this lil' beaut for writing, and it definitely serves that purpose in spades. All other functions and start ups seem to be pretty zippy, too.

The fact that you get a full year of Microsoft Office makes this SUCH a solid value. Yeehaw!",5,One,"Style: 11.6"" | Intel N4020 | 64GB Storage",Verified Purchase,"January 29, 2021",United States

Its very convienent , it has some weight to it but its not too heavy. My favorite option is voice to text so I dont have to do the typing. As a author its great to just speak my mind and it catches it an keeps up with me.

Only issue I have is this thing is constantly updating. Not a bad thing, but I live in a rural area, using antennae based broadband, and it takes forever to update. I have made one trip to the local library, and again at a car dealer while waiting for a repair to be done. The wifi in those places is much faster than I get at home, but it is what it is. Primary use is as a back up or for traveling, so it's OK for use in those situations.",4,One,"Style: 11.6"" | Intel N4000 | 64GB Storage",Verified Purchase,"November 8, 2019",United States

B081V6W99V,R1VC2YIJRIZG48,TGuinn,Great Disappointment-,"I love the size of the device. It worked great until a few months ago. First, the shift key on the right side stopped working. Then, the next day, the Enter key failed to work. Since it’s too late to return it, I figured out a work around. Then last month the Shift key on the left side fails to work to capitalize letters. I have to use the CAP lock key. This weekend, in certain apps the typing feature randomly works or not at all. I have done troubleshooting. Performed updates, etc. nothing resolves these issues.
